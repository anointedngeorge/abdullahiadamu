						Yakin Keffi), the First Executive Governor of Nasarawa 
						State </u></b></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, was born on 
						July 23, 1946 at Keffi.&nbsp; He started his education at the 
						age of 7 in 1953 at Abdu Zanga Primary School, Keffi and 
						completed at the Laminga Senior Primary School in 1959.&nbsp;

						proceeded &nbsp;to Government Technical College Bukuru from 
						1962-1965.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Because of his strong desire for 
						western education, and blessed with a sharp calculating 
						mind, he proceeded to the Kaduna Polytechnic where he 
						read and obtained a National Diploma in Building and 
						Civil Engineering and graduated in 1968.&nbsp; While at the

						and completed in 1971.&nbsp; After the course, he took up 
						appointment with the Northern Nigeria Development 
						Corporation (NNDC) Kaduna, 1972.&nbsp; Thereafter, he moved

						NTA Zone D in 1976 and served up to 1978. Between1980-83 
						he served as the Chairman of Benue Cement Company, Gboko.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">His career in Politics began in 
						earnest 1977 when he was elected into the Constituent 
						Assembly, a body that drafted the country’s Second 
						Republic Constitution of 1979.&nbsp; Thereafter, he became a 
						pioneer member of the National Movement which later 
						metamorphosed into the National Party of Nigeria (NPN).&nbsp; 
						He was the first Secretary of the Party from December 
						1978 and later Chairman of the Party in Plateau State 
						from 1982 up to 1983 when the military terminated the 
						life of the Second Republic.&nbsp; He also served as a member 
						of the National Executive Committee of the Party.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">In 1980, on the death of his father 
						and in consideration of his enormous contribution to the 
						society, he was conferred with the prestigious title of
						<i>SARKIN YAKIN KEFFI</i> by His Royal Highness, the 
						Emir of Keffi, Alhaji Chindo Yamusa II.&nbsp; He therefore 
						inherited his father’s traditional title.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">At the demise of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
						republic in 1983, he went back into the academics and in 
						1987 enrolled in the pioneer class of the part-time Law 
						degree of the University of Jos.&nbsp; By 1992, he added yet 
						another feather to his academic career with an LLB (Hons) 
						from the University of Jos.&nbsp; He enrolled into Nigeria 
						Law School, Lagos where he obtained his BL and was 
						called to the Nigerian bar in December 1993 as a 
						Solicitor and Advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">He was appointed a member of the

						General Sani Abacha Administration for the drafting of a 
						constitution for a new democratic government (the Fourth 
						Republic), i.e. Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu has been involved 
						in writing the Nigerian Constitution twice (1979 &amp; 1999 
						constitutions).</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">In March 1995, he was appointed a 
						Minister of State in the Ministry of Works and Housing 
						of the Federal Republic of Nigeria where he served up to 
						November 17, 1997.&nbsp; During his tenure, he actively

						politics he became a member of the United Nigeria 
						Congress Party (UNCP) and was one of its leading 
						gubernatorial contenders in Nasarawa Sate.&nbsp; His efforts 
						did not materialize as the party, alongside others, was 
						dissolved at the death of General Sani Abacha.&nbsp; At the 
						onset of the current political dispensation in 1998, he 
						became a founding member of the People Democratic Party 
						(PDP) and contested for the position of the Executive 
						Governor of Nasarawa State on its platform.&nbsp; He won the 
						elections conducted on 9<sup>th</sup> January 1999.&nbsp; He 
						was subsequently sworn in as the Executive Governor of 
						Nasarawa State on May 29, 1999.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Governor Abdullahi Adamu assumed 
						leadership of Nasarawa State with a rich background in 
						both the public service and private sector.&nbsp; </p>

						Germany, 1982; Soweto – South Africa, 1995 and the 
						Plaque of Los Angeles – USA, 2000 by the Los Angeles 
						County Council.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Governor Adamu is committed to a 
						total reform of the educational development of Nasarawa 
						State. He remains the only Governor in Nigeria that has 
						committed not less than 28% of the state fiscal 
						appropriation to education. In appreciation of his 
						educational reform agenda, he was honoured with an 
						Honourary Doctorate Degree in Engineering by the Rivers 
						State University of Science and Technology, 
						Port-Harcourt in March 2003. In the same vein, in 
						November 2004, the Federal University of Technology, 
						Akure conferred on him an Honourary Doctorate in 
						Engineering for his contributions to the field of 
						Engineering. On the 11<sup>th</sup> of March, 2006, the

						Administration, to be followed a week later on 18<sup>th</sup> 
						March 2006 with a Doctorate degree in Law by the Nnamdi
