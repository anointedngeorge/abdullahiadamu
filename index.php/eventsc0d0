			<description><![CDATA[<p>By Bala Ibrahim.<br /><br />Politics, particularly party politics, has a special ambition that is geared towards improving people’s status, or increasing power within a country. The debate between parties having power in a country or activities associated with the governance of a country, also fall within the purview of politics. And in the political arrangement of Nigeria today, the party in power is the All Progressives Congress, APC, which is the party that wrestled power from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, forcing it into the opposition since 2015.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>By Bala Ibrahim</strong></em><br /><br />Running a government, a party or an administration can be burdensome, especially if you want to carry everyone along, or have the all-inclusive itch. That feeling of including everything or everyone can be arduous, but not unachievable. As a political party, that is at the threshold of a general election, and an election in which it is intending to rollover its achievements, the APC is faced by many challenges, one of which is internal wrangling. There are still some forces in the party with differences in opinion, that arose from the party primaries all the way to the national convention. While such dissents are normal in democracy, the chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu is not ready to allow them linger for long, especially because campaign for next year’s elections would commence soon, as such, the party must enter the race as a united force.</p>
