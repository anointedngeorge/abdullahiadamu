                    <p><em><strong>Being the Text of an Address Delivered by Senator (Dr.) Abdullahi Adamu, CON (Turakin Keffi), National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the Occasion of the Founders’ Day Ceremony, Tuesday, March 29, 2022.</strong></em><br /><br />PROTOCOLS:<br /><br />I am grateful to Almighty Allah and delighted to join all of you as we celebrate this special occasion of the 2022 Founders’ Day of the university. I congratulate the Visitor of the University, who is also the Governor of Nasarawa State and his administration for the support they continue to give to the university as it makes several determined steps towards becoming one of the best universities of reckoning in Nigeria.<br /><br />The Governing Council, Vice-Chancellor, principal officers and management of the university deserve our special commendation. In the face of various challenges, they have drawn from their depth of managerial experience to balance competing interests and produce graduands who can favourably compete with their peers in Nigeria and internationally. I also commend the academic and non-academic staff of the university for promoting intellectual best practices as they impart knowledge to the students.</p>
 
<p><br /><img src="/images/2022/New1.jpg" alt="" /><br />The university has asked me to reflect on our vision for establishing the Nasarawa State University. I guess they did so purposely; because I happened to be the one, who by the grace of God, was the Governor of Nasarawa State when we took the decision to establish this citadel of learning. But before I put forward my thoughts and reflections, let me pay tribute to all those who gave me the opportunity to serve as the Governor of Nasarawa State from 1999 – 2007. Whatever I may have achieved in the years I served as governor resulted from the massive support our administration got from everyone in the state who stood shoulder to shoulder with me as we took hard decisions to recalibrate the future of our dear state.<br /><br />To put our vision, reflections and thoughts on why we established the Nasarawa State University in proper perspective, we must return to the state of our education when we took over the reins of power in Nasarawa State in May 1999. At that time, what we unfortunately met was an educational system that was not only shocking, but petrifying and disgusting. The sector was in such a bad condition that it could not produce qualified human capital in virtually all areas of human endeavour. It was an educational sector that was derelict, dilapidated and utterly incapable of fulfilling our avowed commitment to make the state a major player in the comity of Nigerian states. In actual sense, truth be told; the sector could not offer even ten candidates with the minimum requirements for admission into the first rate ivy-league Nigerian universities at the end of their secondary school education. Failures in NECO and WAEC examinations were the norm rather than the exception. Our primary and post primary institutions were in a truly indescribable sordid state. The situation we inherited was a near total disaster. We couldn’t face any state of the federation in a contest of intellectual wits. We determined to accept our challenge and then do everything humanly possible to overcome it.<br /><br />It was in that circumstance that we set out to completely reform the educational sector in the state at all levels. We launched a multi-pronged educational reform programme at Ara, Nasarawa Local Government Area, on June 23, 1999, that is, less than a month after we assumed office. Under the programme, our vision was focused on the following: i.    Rehabilitation of existing infrastructure; ii.    Establishment and construction of new primary, secondary and tertiary institutions; iii.    Recruitment of the best educational instructors from anywhere in the world; iv.    Supply of instructional materials; and, v.    Setting up of a standard quality control system.<br /><br />In conjunction with the Local Government administrations in the state, we commenced a programme of rehabilitating almost all the primary schools in the state. We purposely focused our initial attention on those schools located in rural areas where a majority of our population lived and whose children and wards had been denied any form of quality educational opportunity. Then, we stepped forward to build new secondary schools in each of the 147 wards and equipped them with modern infrastructure and learning facilities.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2022/Nasarawa_welcomes_new_Apc_chairman3.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />To remedy the defects in science education, we established two special Science Secondary Schools in each of the three senatorial districts of the state. The near absence of Science teachers meant that we had to quickly embark on recruitment of science subject teachers from across the 36 states of the federation with the incentive of giving those recruited permanent and pensionable appointments. Another critical element in our reform agenda was our decision to allocate 28 per cent of our annual budget to education. That was three per cent higher than the UNESCO target of 25 per cent.<br /><br />About two years into our reform agenda, our efforts began to bear the needed fruits. More than half of our students, who took the West African School Certificate (WASC) and the National Examination Council (NECO) examinations, proved that the fault was not in them but in the system that stunted the full flowering of their intellect. In the 2001/2001 session NECO examination, Nasarawa State was rated the best state in NECO examination.<br /><br />Having provided a solid foundation at the primary and secondary school levels, we realized that there will be the need to allow the budding intellect of our young men and women to blossom to its fullest. In this connection, we took the next logical step in our educational reform and development programme by giving early attention to post-secondary education. Our major drive was to ensure that the products of our reformed educational sector do not have to roam the streets looking for admission in tertiary institutions. It was on this premise that we quickly took the decision to set up the following institutions: i.    Nasarawa State Polytechnic, Lafia; ii.    School of Nursing and Midwifery, Lafia; and, iii.    School of Health Technology, Keffi. These were aimed at solving the critical and immediate middle level manpower needs of the state. However, our ultimate ambition was to set up a world renowned State University. And this was just what we did by the establishment of the Nasarawa State University, Keffi,<br /><br />How did it come about? In September 1999, we caused the Ministry of Education to convene an Education Stake-holders Summit in Lafia. The summit brought together various interest groups within and outside the state to discuss what to do about our dilapidated education sector, especially at the tertiary level. At all strata of the education sector, the assembled stakeholders lamented what had become the glaring decay in our classrooms and institutions. The tales they told of what our young ones were being subjected to was not only disgusting, but disheartening. After listening to their concerns, we intimated the summit of our determination to have a State University. They received the news with a resounding sigh of relief.<br /><br />To ensure total inclusiveness in the decision making process, we took the concurrence of the education summit to the State Executive Council which consequently approved the appointment of a Technical Advisory Committee to advise government on the feasibility of a State University. The committee, made up of outstanding university administrators and technocrats from across the country, had Professor Ochapa Onazi, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jos, as chairman.<br /><br />In its report, the committee affirmed the need for the establishment of a conventional State University to be called Nasarawa State University to be located in Keffi, with the motto: Knowledge for Development. Additionally, the committee advised that the mission statement of the university should be: “… to encourage and enable individuals to develop their full potentials by providing qualitative and stimulating learning environment encompassing a wide range of relevant educational activities for efficient, dedicated and selfless service to the state, the nation and the world at large. This commitment is predicated on its philosophical belief in constructive thinking, positive action and freedom of conscience”<br /><br />We wasted no time in studying every bit of the report of the committee and consequently, towards the end of the year 2000, submitted an executive bill to this effect to the State House of Assembly for the establishment of the university. The House of Assembly passed the bill which I then signed into law known as the Nasarawa State University Law No 2 of 2001.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2022/Nasarawa_Wecomes_new_Apc_chairman2.jpg" alt="" /><br /><br />Let me pause for a moment and reflect that our decision to establish the university was not without its own challenges. A few vocal doubters allowed their skepticism to get the better of them and they embarked on a campaign of calumny to stop this worthy project. At the Education Summit we convened to review the situation of education in the State, they argued that the state did not need a university because it did not have enough financial resources to set up and maintain a university. They said we were embarking on a wasteful venture dictated entirely by what they believed was self-aggrandizement. We were neither discouraged by their criticism nor dismayed by their skepticism. We refused to let the bright sun of our vision be blurred by the dark clouds of their short-sightedness. We knew we were right and we knew they were wrong. In retrospect, we can say now that we have overcome the skepticism of the short-sighted and we have overcome the fears of the uninformed. The state university stands today as an eternal monument with clarity of vision plus focus and courage multiplied by commitment.<br /><br />Once the University Law was in place, we knew that there was no longer going to be anything to hold us back from building a world class citadel of learning. In spite of our very lean resources, we immediately began to mobilize both human and material resources towards commencing academic activities in the university. To help us in setting the foundations right, we proceeded to set up an Implementation Committee under the chairmanship of the world renowned university administrator, Prof. Adamu Baikie, CON.<br /><br />The committee worked out and submitted to us a comprehensive blue print for the take – off of the university. Amongst the issues attended to by the committee were a development plan, number of faculties and academic programmes. They also prepared a funding plan as well as an admission schedule. Following the submission of their report in October 2001, the university officially took off in February, 2002 for the 2001/2002 academic session with the first set of students. By mid-year 2002, the first set of students were matriculated and academic activities went full stream.<br /><br />Due to the excellent advisory work the Implementation Committee did, we were later to persuade Professor Adamu Baikie to stay on and become the first Vice-Chancellor of the University. The appointment of Professor Baikie came with its own share of criticism. To be truthful, we were openly berated for appointing a Christian as the first vice chancellor of the university. We were not perturbed because what we wanted was a university that is set on a solid foundation, built by the best experts in university administration, wherever they came from.<br /><br />At this point, I must spare a moment to commend the enviable foundational work done by the pioneer vice-chancellor of the university, Professor Adamu Baikie. He drew from his wealth of experience and expertise in university administration to draw the best academic brains from across the country. His profile was an inviting magnet that drew academic and non-academic staff from various other institutions to propel this university to a high pedestal within a very short period. At the time of his departure, the university had not less than 36 world acclaimed professors.<br /><br />Today, our determination and resoluteness in carrying on with our convictions is here for everyone to see. The university currently stands at the peak of all state universities, beating even some federal owned universities in facilities and intellectual output. We cannot be any happier for the growth of the university. I am informed that almost all the academic programmes of the university have full accreditation of the National Universities Commission. New courses are being introduced on an annual basis. The graduates of the university are excelling in their chosen vocations in the state and across the country. Indeed, we ensured that all the first set of graduands from the university were absorbed into the State public service. Today, they are contributing their quota to the development of the State. There are even stories of some who are showcasing their intellectual competencies and winning laurels in other countries of the world. We cannot be any happier for ear tingling tales we hear of what the products of this university are achieving everywhere. In modesty, we may not want to beat our chest in congratulations, but do we have a choice? I leave the answer to you, the audience.<br /><br />Now, let’s move to a different perspective. A university is a capital-intensive social service. Adequate funding is critical to its success. It is important that we place on record the sacrifices our administration did to ensure that the university did not face financial challenges in its early years. Between May 1999 when we came on board to December 2004, allocation to the state from the federation account was a mere 680 million to 900 million naira a month. Internally generated revenue was less than 10 million naira a month. Yet in the face of this, we ensured, in conjunction with the local governments, that our vision was not aborted through underfunding of the university.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the funding challenges in the immediate past has virtually crippled federal and state universities in the country. This is, today, compounded by the global challenges in the fiscal sector which is worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. Even though from its commencement, we took steps to prevent the Nasarawa State University from suffering the fate of underfunding, the rapid growth of the university means that more resources are required to keep up with the tempo and pace of development. And Nasarawa State is by any means not a rich state. I therefore call on all and sundry to support the university through endowments for it to maintain and surpass the achievements it has made so far.<br /><br />In all countries, universities do not depend entirely on government funding. Indeed, very few governments, if any, could provide all the financial needs of their universities. All universities require supportive funding by way of grants from corporate bodies and endowments by wealthy individuals and families. I am delighted to hear that the university’s Directorate of Linkages is connecting the university with wealthy individuals, ivy league universities around the world and the organized private sector. TETFund is also making huge investments in infrastructure and human capital development. This is delightful as a university is the greatest legacy we can bequeath to our children.<br /><br />As I conclude these reflections, let me put on record our gratitude to the Visitor of the University and Governor of Nasarawa State, Engr. Abdullahi Sule for the support he continues to provide to the university. There is no doubt that your political and financial support has been instrumental to the growth witnessed in the university of recent. You have done well. Continue to do well.<br /><br />I express deep appreciation to successive Chancellors, Governing Councils, Vice-Chancellors and Managements of the University for the determined zeal to ensure that the university continues to grow and excel in all fields of endeavour. Your commitment to the university gives me joy and satisfaction.
