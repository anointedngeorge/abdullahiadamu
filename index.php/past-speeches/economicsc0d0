I am particularly pleased that the honourable minister of agriculture and rural development, Alhaji Mohammed Sabo Nanono, is here with us. His presence is the very visible presence of the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR. Please permit me, therefore, to pay a special tribute to you, honourable minister, as a farmer and as a minister, on whose shoulders now rests the burden of formulating pragmatic agricultural policies towards our national ambition of giving back to agriculture its pride of place in our national development.</p>
