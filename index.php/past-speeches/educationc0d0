			<description><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Being the Text of an Address Delivered by Senator (Dr.) Abdullahi Adamu, CON (Turakin Keffi), National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the Occasion of the Founders’ Day Ceremony, Tuesday, March 29, 2022.</strong></em><br /><br />PROTOCOLS:<br /><br />I am grateful to Almighty Allah and delighted to join all of you as we celebrate this special occasion of the 2022 Founders’ Day of the university. I congratulate the Visitor of the University, who is also the Governor of Nasarawa State and his administration for the support they continue to give to the university as it makes several determined steps towards becoming one of the best universities of reckoning in Nigeria.<br /><br />The Governing Council, Vice-Chancellor, principal officers and management of the university deserve our special commendation. In the face of various challenges, they have drawn from their depth of managerial experience to balance competing interests and produce graduands who can favourably compete with their peers in Nigeria and internationally. I also commend the academic and non-academic staff of the university for promoting intellectual best practices as they impart knowledge to the students.</p>
