                    <p>By Rabiu Abdullahi<br /><br />He has finally joined the race. It is no longer rumours. Governor Abdullahi Adamu of Nasarawa State is among the aspirants seeking to replace President Olusegun Obasanjo as the next occupant of the Aso Rock Presidential Villa, Abuja, come May 29, 2007.</p>
 
<p>This article is not about the chances of the charismatic first civilian governor of the young Nasarawa State winning, or not winning the race. But suffice to say that Governor Adamu has a high prospect of making it as the next president. The basis on which I arrive at this conclusion will be the subject of another article. My motive for now is to enunciate those qualities I believe Governor Adamu has, and can offer towards improving the politics and governance of Nigeria.<br /><br />Not many political analysts will dispute the fact that Governor Adamu is today among the leading politicians and statesmen in this country. Even his critics and political adversaries are often compelled to admit this fact when they come in contact with the man, whose admirers refer to as the "Bridge Builder", on account of his ability at reconciling conflicts among diverse groups and interests.<br /><br />Those who are conversant with the pluralistic set up of Nasarawa State will attest to the political savvy and skills of Governor Adamu. In 1999, no one gave him, not even a dog's chance of becoming the governor of the state. But in the end he won the polls and was again returned to office in 2003 with an whelming of votes. This is a clear endorsement of his track record of achievements in delivering the democratic dividend to the people, in spite of the meager financial resources of the state.<br /><br />The consummate politician that he is, Governor Adamu has ensured that Nasarawa State remains a Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) controlled state. All the other political parties in the state exist only in name or are even unheard of in the case of some.<br /><br />As the "chief Steward" of the state, Governor Adamu has remained the dominant political factor, calling the shots as far as Nasarawa State is concerned. Many a political analysts have adduced various reasons for this.<br /><br />But as some one who had the privilege of working closely with the governor as his Director of Press Affairs (DOPA) I wish to explain that the reason for the Governor's seeming larger than life political stature is on account of his magnanimity. After he was sworn-in as the Governor of the state, not only did he publicly sought the co-operation of all leading politicians in the state, but Governor Adamu went the extra mile to regularly visit and consult with these leading politicians especially those in the opposing camp.<br /><br />Either individually or collectively, Governor Adamu sought the advise of all the top politicians on how best to govern the state.<br /><br />Indeed, those who were willing, irrespective of whether they belong to the ruling PDP, were assigned roles or functions in the process of governance .<br /><br />To say that Governor Adamu ran a broad-based state government whose membership cut across political, religious and ethnic divides, is merely acknowledging an obvious fact. The records are there to verify.<br /><br />I venture to say that it is this magnanimity of Governor Adamu that later pitched him against some of his party collegues in the state. They found it hard to accept a situation in which the governor accommodated those that never wanted him as a person to become the governor, nor for the PDP as a party to win the state elections. For those against his magnanimity, it was like he was tossing the children's bread to their dogs. But Governor Adamu believes sincerely that even the dogs have the right to feed from the crumbs that fall from their master's table.<br /><br />On account of this, the governor was maligned and called all sorts of names and blackmailed with all sorts of allegations and petitions. But he remained steadfast rightly believing that Nasarawa State belongs to all those who are either indegenes or live and earn their livelihood there-in.<br /><br />Governor Adamu does not believe in the political theory of "winner takes all". It is his conviction that only a united people can build a peaceful and stable polity, and that this cannot be achieved if those in opposition were to be neglected just because they hold different political views.<br /><br />Indeed it was Governor Adamu's commitment to unity of the people that saw him remained dogged in handling the many and varying conflicts that posed threats to the survival of Nasarawa State. One of such conflicts was the long-standing ethno- cultural crisis that had lingered between the Egbura and Bassa speaking ethnic groups of Toto Local Government Area of the state.<br /><br />While previous administrations of both the old Plateau State and Nasarawa State adopted timid approaches at proffering solutions to the this re-current bloody conflicts between the two groups, Governor Adamu opted to tackle it not only with great determination and zeal, but he remained resolute and demonstrated fairness, justice and firmness, which are qualities expected of a true and up right leader.<br /><br />Similarly when in 2007 the unfortunate political cum ethnic crisis erupted in the Southern Senatorial district of the state, Governor Adamu showed what a good statesman he is. The governor resisted all pressures mounted on him to single out the Tiv speaking of Nasarawa State for persecution. The crisis was occasioned by politico-cultural disputes between the Tivs on the one hard and other ethnic groups in the area on the other hand.<br /><br />Had Governor Adamu succumbed to the pressures, perhaps Nasarawa State and not Plateau State would have been the first state to have a state of emergency imposed on it, on account of inability to maintain law and order. The governor firmly stood against suggestions from some quarters that the Tiv people of Nasarawa State should be exiled to their ancestral homes in neighbouring Benue State. The Tivs were alleged to have been the master minds behind the crisis which led to loss of many lives, including those of top state government officials.<br /><br />Today, in retrospect, the governor's resolute stand is being appreciated by all and sundry who adjudge it as a great foresight. Governor Adamu has indeed shown that a good leader is one who in moments of madness remains cool, collects himself together and take decision that would ensure the survival of the polity and not one that will lead to its disintegration.<br /><br />Evidently the decision taken by Governor Adamu on the crisis has helped to strengthen the bond of unity among the people of Benue and Nasarawa State in particular, and the entire Middle Belt or North-central zone of the country. Governor Adamu has indeed demonstrated that he is capable of resisting and avoiding pressures and actions capable of dismembering the Nigerian nation-state.<br /><br />Beyond Nasarawa State, Governor Adamu demonstrated this nationalistic attributes when in 2001 the nation was threatened with chaos on account of the assault by the infamous Area Boys in Lagos on other Nigerians, particularly those of Northern extractions. As the then double chairman of Nigeria Governor's Forum and Northern Governor's Forum, Governor Adamu promptly visited Lagos, disregarding security concerns. While in Lagos he inspected virtually all the trouble spots and calmed frayed nerves, thereby preventing the anticipated mass exodus of Nigerians out of the Lagos area, a development which could have stirred or possibly led to retaliatory measures, consequently undermining the unity and survival of the country.<br /><br />Besides, Nigerians could not have forgotten in a hurry the role Governor Adamu and some of his colleagues played in resolving the series of face-offs between the presidency and the National Assembly, particularly when the late Dr Chuba Okadigbo was the Senate president. These and other numerous actions of Governor Adamu attest to his high sense of patriotism and avowed commitment to the survival of democracy in Nigeria. What other qualities can Nigerians demand from those who seek to preside over their political affairs?<br /><br />Nigerian Newsday, July 19, 2006</p>	            </div>
