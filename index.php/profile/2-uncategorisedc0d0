He represented Nigeria at the United Nations heads of state and government conference to review the charter of the Earth Summit in June1997 in New York.<br /><br />At the lifting of the ban on politics he became a member of the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) and was one of its leading gubernatorial contenders in Nasarawa Sate. His efforts did not materialize as the party, alongside others, was dissolved at the death of General Sani Abacha. At the onset of the current political dispensation in 1999, he became the Executive Governor of Nasarawa State.

An election which he eventually won and has since then been serving as a senator in the Red Chamber to date. He won a third term in the February 23, 2019 senatorial elections under the flag of the All Progressive Congress (APC).<br /><br />After holding the traditional title of Sarkin Yakin Keffi for thirty-nine (39) years, on June 6th, 2019, a day after the Feast of Fasting (Eid el-Fitri), Senator Abdullahi Adamu was conferred with the new title of TURAKIN KEFFI at a grand ceremony conducted by the Emir of Keffi, Alhaji (Dr.) Shehu Chindo Yamusa II.<br /><br />During his time in the Senate, he contributed significantly to the passage of many national legislations for the good governance of Nigeria.

The appointment afforded him the opportunity to interact with the existing grievances in the party, its triggers and possibly mitigating factors. Senator Adamu performed creditably in the reconciliation assignment and was able, alongside other members, to resolve many of the mis-understandings existing in the party. The assignment also afforded him the opportunity to have a hand-on feel of the challenges facing the party in various states of the federation, as well as warm himself up among the party members.<br /><br />Having finished the assignment to the satisfaction of party members, and with the National Convention of the APC only months away, Senator Adamu began to consult widely on his interest to assume the Chairmanship of the Party. Coming after his sterling success in the National Reconciliation assignment, the response he got was overwhelming. He formally declared interest in the office of National Chairman by mid-February, 2022.<br /><br />At the National Convention of the Party held at the Eagle Square in Abuja on 26 March 2022, Senator Adamu was unanimously elected as the National Chairman of the APC. He comes into the office with a wealth of political experience spanning over 50 years during which he has served in all branches and strata of government. His vision is to make the APC a smart and responsive political party, able to fulfill the aspirations and hopes of all Nigerians.<br /><br />Senator Abdullahi Adamu is a lover of sports, especially Football, Lawn Tennis, Squash, Cricket, Hockey and Athletics.<br /><br />His hobbies include Current Affairs, Farming and Music.<br /><br />Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu has visited the following countries, amongst others: Great Britain, USA, Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Switzerland, Canada, Turkey, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Jamaica, India, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yugoslavia, Kenya, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique, South Africa.<br /><br />A well-rounded man, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, Lawyer, Engineer, Technocrat, Farmer and consummate politician is married and has six children.<br /><br /><br /></p>
