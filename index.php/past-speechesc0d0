This extra-ordinary emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) is evidence that we have overcome. Whatever were our problems in the immediate past, we have shown once more that APC is not just a political party; it is a united and unbreakable family. Yesterday we trembled but today we must feel free to dance owambe.</p>
