                    <p>By Bala Ibrahim.<br /><br />Politics, particularly party politics, has a special ambition that is geared towards improving people’s status, or increasing power within a country. The debate between parties having power in a country or activities associated with the governance of a country, also fall within the purview of politics. And in the political arrangement of Nigeria today, the party in power is the All Progressives Congress, APC, which is the party that wrestled power from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, forcing it into the opposition since 2015.</p>
 
<p>Because of the unanticipated nature of that feat, alongside the immense enthusiasm of Nigerians to urgently arrive at the Eldorado, expectations were arrested by impatience, which gave way to anxiety, nervousness, and general unease about the government’s sincerity of purpose, to the timely delivery of the promised democratic dividends. Yes, the party became a victim of misinterpretation, misapprehension and downright delusion.<br /><br />Genuine as some of these reservations are, and despite the fact that the government was challenged by some factors, the APC is determined not to let such skepticism migrate to misgivings, hence the effort put in place to bring in Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, to play the part of a bridge builder at this critical point. There is a slogan that says; Good things come to those who wait.<br /><br />Patience help in improving our ability to accept setbacks and enjoy life much more, by allowing us to persevere and make more productive decisions. Some of these decisions involve the reversal of the narrative that turns every issue into a tissue of lies. As the chairman of the APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu has arrived with such sense of purpose or intention to deliver, on the core mandate of the party, and by extension, the government.<img style="float: left;" src="/images/portraits/Potrait_r400.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="376" /><br /><br />Since march this year, when he emerged as the national chairman of the party, the road became sign posted, for a party with the intention of executing a knowledge based agenda, that would be addressing issues in accordance with its manifesto, as a political vehicle of transformation.<br /><br />Therefore, inspired by such party manifesto, particularly the prescribed ambition to devolve powers, duties and responsibilities to states and local governments, in order to entrench the spirit of true Federalism, the Abdullahi Adamu administration has been working assiduously, towards attracting the best and brightest into politics and public service.<br /><br />This is done through the aggressive recruitment of private sector people, academics and professionals within and outside Nigeria. The aim is to help the governments, at the federal, state and local levels, succeed in the mission to shade off what is sometimes referred to as, the “excess fat”.<br /><br />Yes, pre the arrival of the APC, Nigeria went grossly fat or overweight, with bloated and inefficient expenditure, mostly brought about by corruption and poor economic management. The APC came under the mantra of change, and started the “Tummy Tuck” procedure, that set the ball rolling for the oil sector revolutionary phenomena. That is one issue that is being turned into some tissues of lies.<br /><br />As a Senator, Abdullahi Adamu worked with colleagues in the law making arm of the government, to ensure that the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill became a law, by providing the legal framework for the selling of shares, that turns the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, into a private, and hopefully profitable company. It’s a difficult and painful decision, but the end result of such tummy trimming is now toning down Nigeria’s bloated abdomen, to an efficiently manageable position. These are measures that cannot be easily achieved through the conventional economic sit-ups.<br /><br />But with people like Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, who have the will and wherewithal for a better Nigeria, shaping the body politic of the country is taken as a task that must be done, regardless of those who may want to turn every issue into a tissue of lies. The commendation coming from the oil industry now, is an indication of such solemn success.<br /><br />Because of his antecedents in the struggle for a better Nigeria, as well as a seasoned reformer, the Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu arrived with a special vigour, the vigour of helping governments save money and increase efficiency in all sectors of the economy.<br /><br />It may interest the reader to know that Senator Abdullahi Adamu started his foray into politics in 1977, as an elected member of the Constituent Assembly, the body that drafted the Nigeria’s Second Republic Constitution of 1979. He was one of the pioneer members of the National Movement, which changed to the National Party of Nigeria, NPN. He served as the Secretary, and later Chairman of the NPN in Plateau State in 1980, and by 1993, former Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha, appointed him as a member of the National Constitutional Conference, to draft the constitution for a new democratic government. He was later appointed the Minister of State in the Ministry of Works and Housing in 1995.<br /><br />At the lifting of the ban on politics in 1997, Abdullahi Adamu joined the defunct United Nigeria Congress Party, UNCP. With the return of democracy to Nigeria in 1999, Adamu joined the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, where he contested and won the governorship election in Nasarawa State by a landslide. He was re-elected with a massive landslide.<br /><br />Adamu has been a Senator since 2011, from where he was elected to lead the APC at the highest level in March this this year, and the match is to match words with action, through the talk of issues, and not the tissue of lies.</p>	            </div>
