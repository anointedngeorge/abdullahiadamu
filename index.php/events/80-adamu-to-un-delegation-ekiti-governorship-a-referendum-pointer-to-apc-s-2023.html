                    <p><em><strong>Assures Peaceful, Credible Elections</strong></em></p>
<p>Ahead of the 2023 General Elections, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) of the United Nations and Head of the UN Office for West and Sahel, Mr. Mahamat Saleh Annadif visited the National Leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Party’s National Secretariat in Abuja.</p>
 
<p>Mr. Mahamat Saleh Annadif who led an 8-member delegation was received by the APC National Chairman, H.E. Sen. Abdullahi Adamu represented by the Party’s Deputy National Chairman (North), Sen. Abubakar Kyari.</p>
<p>The UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General stated:</p>
<p>“We met this morning with officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and we plan to meet with all the key actors in Nigeria with a very simple message. We will like to see the coming elections going peacefully and accepted in all parts of Nigerians. With the APC in power, you have a very important role to play. We will like to emphasize that the UN is with you and supporting you.</p>
<p>“As I like to say, when Nigeria sneezes, the entire region catches cold. So we like and hope that Nigeria stays in good health and be the locomotive for other regions and this is why we will expect the APC to support peaceful elections. Thank you very much for welcoming our delegation and we hope to come back to celebrate the peaceful elections.”</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/2022/image220628001.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Remarks by Sen. Abubakar Kyari:</strong></p>
<p>“I wish to, on behalf of the National Chairman of the APC, His Excellency Senator Dr. Abdullahi Adamu, and the NWC welcome His Excellency Mr. Annadif Mahamat Saleh to the APC National Secretariat.</p>
<p>"The SRSG is a neighbour and good friend of Nigeria whose various experiences in public life in the Republic of Chad has encompassed many high offices of state.</p>
<p>"We recall your memorable visit to Nigeria last year that still resonates in the country particularly your meeting with His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and other senior government officials.</p>
<p>"We note the high level positions that Africans occupy in the international system and the key roles that they have been playing. These include the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Muhammad, the Director-General of WHO, Dr. Tedros Ghebrehyesus, The Director-General of WTO, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and the SRSG, Mr. Annadif Mahamat Saleh among many others</p>
<p>"I recall that His Excellency Annadif had been Foreign Minister, Chief of Staff to the President as well as Secretary-General in the Presidency in Chad. His present position as Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations to West Africa and the Sahel presents him with a wider vista to apply his vast diplomatic experience and his versatile knowledge of languages.</p>
<p>"Since his appointment as SRSG he has been grappling with various issues confronting his office which include the multidimensional and protracted conflicts in Mali and Burkina Faso, the ravages of climate change in West Africa and the Sahel, the problems of terrorism in the region, issue related to population explosion in the region, the forceful change in governments in some West African states, as well as the complex issues involved in achieving sustainable development in the region through the implementation of the UN's Agenda 2030.</p>
<p>"It is against this backdrop that the National Chairman and the NWC views the visit by the SRSG today to the APC National Secretariat as both auspicious and important.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/images/2022/image220628002.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>"The UN Secretary-General His Excellency Antonio Guterres, visited Nigeria not long ago during which he met with His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, and undertook a visit to Borno State to inspect the situation in the State for himself.</p>
<p>"It is gratifying that the SG found things to his satisfaction in Borno and even commended the State Governor, His Excellency Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, mni, for his courage and determination to end the insurgency and complete the arduous work of return, resettlement, reintegration and reorientation of IDPs and refugees.</p>
<p>"The greatest challenge facing Borno State as of today is adequate funding of the State Government's resettlement projects that would require the reconstruction of entire towns and villages and restoration of services like electricity, water and sanitation and reopening of schools and hospitals in virtually all parts of the State</p>
<p>"The Party calls for a concerted effort on the part of the UN and the rest of the international community to support the process of peace-building and reconstruction in Borno State and other parts of Nigeria that have been adversely affected by insurgency and other forms of unrest and insecurity.</p>
<p>"The Party also notes the work of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General as encompassing various elements of the United Nations mandate more especially in areas such as achieving sustainable development in accordance with the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals or Agenda 2030. This is a critical vehicle towards the achievement of various other human development targets and goals including peace and security, addressing the impacts of climate change in Africa especially in the Sahel region and the Lake Chad Basin, advancing the rights of women and young people, combating desertification, and preventing illegal migration from West Africa to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>"We commend the SRSG for his work in all these areas particularly in addressing the subject of women, peace and security in West Africa and the Sahel region where women have been exposed to egregious violence and human rights abuses of various sorts.</p>
<p>"We wish to inform the SRSG that the APC is poised to go into the general elections in the country with commitment to observing the rule of law and intend to participate peacefully. Bring the ruling Party and one with the largest number of registered members numbering 43 million people, the APC has every stake in the orderly and peaceful conduct of the elections across Nigeria.</p>
<p>"The APC considers the gubernatorial election that recently took place in Ekiti State as a referendum and a vote of confidence in the Party and a pointer to 2023 when the Party hopes to form the government in the center and also in most of the states across the six geopolitical zones of the country.</p>
<p>"The APC to assures the entire UN body through the SRSG that the APC is committed to the ideals of democratic governance and observance of rule of law in all its undertakings, and shall continue to apply them diligently while canvassing for votes and while it forms the next national government in 2023.</p>
<p>"APC is pleased to inform you of the progress made in Nigeria especially in the area of infrastructure development since the APC came into power in 2015. He should reaffirm the commitment of the Party to take Nigeria to higher levels of material and cultural development in the coming years particularly by the holistic implementation of the UN SDGs as well as the African Union Agenda 2063 and the AU Programme of Infrastructure Development (PIDA).</p>
<p>"The Party reiterates commitment of Nigeria to recharging of the Lake Chad as an urgent priority for the members of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) which includes Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. He should also reiterate Nigeria's desire to reinforce the LCBC Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) towards combatting terrorism and other forms of international crime across our common borders.</p>
<p>"The APC looks forward to further deepening of cooperation between the Office of the SRSG and the APC in all matters of governance towards advancement of ECOWAS, African Union and United Nations best practices.</p>
<p>"Finally, we wish the SRSG a successful visit to Nigeria and to urge him to feel at home because he is truly in his own country."</p>
