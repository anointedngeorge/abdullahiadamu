Governor of Nasarawa State<O:P>  </SPAN></font><SPAN lang=EN-US style="COLOR: red; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><U> </O:P></U></SPAN></B></h2>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US><FONT face=Arial size=3><img border="1" src="/images/profile2.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="142">Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu was born on 
July 6, 1945 at Keffi. He started his education at the age of 7 at Abdu Zanga 
Primary School, Keffi and completed at the Laminga Senior Primary School in 
1959. His Post-Primary education started at the now Government Secondary School, 
Makurdi from 1960-1962, from where he proceeded to Government Technical College, 
Bukuru from 1963 - 1965.&nbsp;</FONT><O:P> </O:P></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Because of his strong desire for 
Western education, and blessed with a sharp calculating mind, he proceeded to 
the Kaduna Polytechnic where he read and obtained a National Diploma in Building 
and Civil Engineering and graduated in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><img border="1" src="/images/profile1.jpg" align="left" width="150" height="299">He had a short employment after 
the diploma course with the National Electric Power Authority as a maintenance 
supervisor. Later he left for a Higher National Diploma at Kaduna Polytechnic 
and completed in 1970. After the course, he took up appointment with the 
Northern Nigeria Development Corporation (NNDC) Kaduna. Thereafter, he moved to 
the private sector where he became a Consultant Area Manager with AEK, a firm of 
consultants. In 1975, he was appointed the Executive Secretary of BEPCO (Benue-Plateau Construction Company) with headquarters in Jos.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">His stint with Politics began in 
1977 when he was elected into the Constituent Assembly, a body that drafted the 
country�s Second Republic Constitution of 1979. Thereafter, he became a pioneer 
member of the National Movement which later metamorphosed into the National 
Party of Nigeria (NPN). He was the Secretary and later Chairman of the NPN in 
Plateau State and also a member of the National Executive Committee of the 
party.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In 1980, as a result of his 
enormous contribution to the society, he was honoured with the prestigious title 
of SARKIN YAKIN KEFFI by His Royal Highness, the Emir of Keffi, Alhaji Chindo 
Yamusa II. <O:P></O:P></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">At the demise of the 
2<SUP>nd</SUP> republic in 1983, he went back into the academics and enrolled in 
the pioneer class of the part-time Law degree of the University of Jos. By 1992, 
he added yet another feather to his academic career with a Law Degree from the 
University of Jos. He was enrolled into the Nigeria Law School, Lagos and was 
called to the bar in 1993 as a Solicitor and Advocate of the Supreme Court of

of Nigeria where he served up to November 17, 1997. During his tenure, he 
actively participated in the UN-sponsored programme for urban, housing and 
environmental development known as "habitat II". He led the Nigerian delegation 
to the conference in Istanbul, Turkey, in June/July 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">At the lifting of the ban on 
politics he became a member of the United Nigeria Congress Party (UNCP) and was 
one of its leading gubernatorial contenders in Nasarawa State. His ambition was 
however not realised as the party, alongside others, was dissolved at the death 
of General Sani Abacha. At the onset of the current political dispensation, he 
became a founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party {PDP} and contested for 
the position of the Executive Governor of Nasarawa State on its platform. He won 
the elections conducted on 9<SUP>th</SUP> January, 1999. He was subsequently 
sworn in as the Executive Governor of Nasarawa State on May 29, 1999.</SPAN></P>
