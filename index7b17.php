The debate between parties having power in a country or activities associated with the governance of a country, also fall within the purview of politics.

That feeling of including everything or everyone can be arduous, but not unachievable. As a political party, that is at the threshold of a general election, and an election in which it is intending to rollover its achievements, the APC is faced by many challenges, one of which is internal wrangling. There are still some forces in the party with differences in opinion, that arose from the party primaries all the way to the national convention. While such dissents are normal in democracy, the chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu is not ready to allow them linger for long, especially because campaign for next year’s elections would commence soon, as such, the party must enter the race as a united force.&lt;/p&gt;
