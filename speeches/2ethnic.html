    Executive Governor of Nasarawa State</p>

</b>
<p>God, in His infinite wisdom, made our dear country a rainbow collection of 
tribes and tongues. The rainbow in the sky is a thing of beauty. But we seem 
blind to the beauty in our rainbow collection of tribes and tongues. Instead, we 
find mutual suspicion, hate and fear in other tongues and tribes. Consequently, 
several parts of our country are today convulsed in inter and intra-ethnic 
conflicts leading to loss of lives as well as the destruction of private and 
public property. The gun is beginning to rule and ruin our country. This 
inexorable march to perdition must be halted. We must halt it.</p>
<p align="left">We have taken the first step towards halting this unwanted march 
with our gathering at this forum. The solution to every human problem begins 
with a gathering of this nature provided the participants resist the temptation 
to turn it into an academic talk shop. We too must resist that temptation. The 
matter before us is too urgent and too serious to permit the luxury of academic 
hair-splitting. We can find the instrument to forge a binding bond of unity from 
our diversity in tribes and tongues in our heads and in our hearts. We must find 
that instrument. It is a self-evident truth that unless we forge this bond of 
unity and urgently too, we will continue to dissipate our energy and waste 
valuable resources in containing eruptions of mutual hate among our people. Our 
nation cannot progress with its feet firmly stuck in the molten lead of 
retrogression. Our collective challenge, as leaders of our people, is to set our 
nation free from its continued self-victimization.</p>
<p align="left">The government and people of Nasarawa State, most sincerely 
welcome this effort. We fully identify ourselves with it because our poor, 
struggling state and its people are victims of ethnic conflicts. Perhaps, more 
than most people, we desire an urgent solution to them. We thank President 
Olusegun Obasanjo for initiating this forum. It is our sincere hope that our 
discussions will be free, fair, honest and constructive. Above all, we must seek 
to offer pragmatic solutions to the problems of ethnic conflicts in our country. 
We must address these problems in a spirit of mutual accommodation if we are to 
avert a greater calamity in our country. The history of human conflicts shows 
clearly that wars often begin from minor personal, sectional, economic, 
political, social and even religious disagreements. No one must pretend to be 
indifferent to what is happening in our country. Let those states which have not 
had these convulsions delude themselves into believing that they are immune to 
them. They are not. These crises cast a long shadow over the nation.</p>
<p align="left">No part of Nigeria can consider itself safe when other parts are 
burning. The threat of anarchy in any part of our country is the threat of 
anarchy in the entire nation. Our nation can develop meaningfully and nurture 
its democracy only in a peaceful atmosphere in which respect for human lives and 
property is a fundamental article of our national faith. We believe we are all 
committed to the sustenance of democracy in our country. We believe we are all 
committed to moving Nigeria forward in peace and not in pieces.</p>
<p align="left">We believe that working together we can turn the tide against 
the anarchists and rescue our nation from the brink of self-destruction. We make 
our contribution at this forum in the fervent hope that it will assist us in our 
obviously arduous and unenviable task of finding a meaningful and lasting 
solution to the frequent inter- and intra-ethnic conflicts not just in the 
North-Central zone but throughout the country. </p>
<p>We would wish to proceed with our discussion from what we have experienced in 
the North-Central geo-political zone to give you a feel of how far inter and 
intra-ethnic hatred and intolerance have convulsed our community and retarded 
its progress. We begin with a general introduction and proceed to the nature and 
the causes of these conflicts with a brief history of the zone. The second part 
of the presentation deals with the larger Nigerian society. We conclude by 
offering suggestions on how to contain this conflict, or in the current 
parlance, on the way forward.</p>
<u><b>
<p>Introduction</p>
</b></u>
<p>Since the return of democracy to Nigeria on May 29, 1999, parts of the Middle 
Belt region now better known by its new geo-political identity as North-Central 
Zone, have witnessed a series of communal, religious, inter and intra-ethnic 
crises resulting into mindless destruction of lives and property. The most 
affected states in the zone are Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states. 
Although Kaduna and Bauchi states are not strictly within this zone, the crises 
in the two states have had some effect on the zone itself. Most of what we say 
here about our zone is more or less applicable to both Kaduna and Bauchi states.
</p>
<p>Generally, these clashes have reduced towns (Kaduna and Jos) and villages to 
charred evidence of the new spirit of intolerance stalking parts of our dear 
nation. When the president himself visited Kaduna in the wake of the crisis, he 
could not find words either to express his revulsion at the degree of 
destruction or to condemn the perpetrators of the mayhem. For a president who is 
not known to be short of words, this must have been a great source of grief for 
him. These crises have turned thousands of people into pitiable refugees in 
their own homes and communities. Unfortunately, the state governments do not 
have the financial means to adequately respond to the resettlement and security 
needs of these helpless victims.</p>
<p>The bloody clashes in Benue and Taraba states were inter-state and 
inter-ethnic; those in Plateau (Jos), Nasarawa (southern senatorial zone of the 
state) and Kaduna states were/are intra-state and inter-ethnic. The crisis in 
Bauchi was both inter-ethnic and inter-state. There is thus a common 
characteristic of inter-ethnicity in all these clashes. There is a religious 
coloration to the clashes in Kaduna and Jos. The religious coloration seeks to 
mask the underlying fundamental cause or causes of these crises. However its 
interpretation by interested analysts gives the impression that it can stand on 
its own. We will so treat it but bear in mind that religion is quite often a 
ready weapon employed to gain advantage or obtain a victim status in the 
unending ethnic quest for social, political and economic advantages. 
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the fact that the religious coloration has become 
as dangerous and nearly as intractable as the fundamental cause or causes of 
these inter-ethnic clashes.</p>
<u><b>
<p>Causes of Ethnic Conflicts in North-Central Zone</p>
</b></u>
<p>Various explanations, some bordering on applied sociology, have been offered 
for these crises. There are suggestions that they are a passing phase in a 
nation that has found its freedom after many years of dictatorship. It may well 
be that democracy has unleashed personal freedom that some of us find ourselves 
unequipped to properly manage, leading to a heady expression of same. It may 
well be that under democracy, our right to have our say has been turned into a 
licence to be right. It may even well may be that the latent fissiparous forces 
now find a discordant expression and violent release in the country. But these 
crises are not, repeat, not a passing phase in a country grappling with the 
dynamics of nationhood. There are various dimensions to them. Indeed, some of 
the underlying causes are probably as old as the nation itself, even if they 
only simmered beneath the surface. In our view, we can look at these problems 
from three historical perspectives.</p>
<p>But first, a brief political history of the North- Central Zone itself. The 
zone is home to nearly all the ethnic groups in the country. Indeed, the major 
tribes �Hausa/Fulani, Igbo and Yoruba are found here. Numerous minority ethnic 
groups, numbering about 50, the largest of whom being the Tiv are found in four 
states � Benue, Taraba, Plateau and Nasarawa � are also here. No other zone in 
the country can boast of this degree of ethnic diversity as the North-Central 
zone. </p>
<p>Migration into this region took many forms and happened at various times in 
our history. The old Kwararafa and Nupe empires must have been responsible for 
the great gathering of the tribes, particularly the minority ethnic groups, in 
this region. The Fulani jihad of the 19</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1">th</font><font FACE="Times New Roman"> 
century brought a new religion, Islam, and a new wave of Hausa/Fulani migrants 
into the zone. Thus the Hausa/Fulani ruling dynasties are firmly established in 
Keffi and Nasarawa in Nasarawa State. It is not exactly known what gave rise to 
the Kanuri migration from the north-east to this region. But they came and 
people of that extraction are found mostly in what is now Lafia local government 
area in Nasarawa State. They are the traditional ruling class there. The Igbo 
and the Yoruba must have come to the region for a number of reasons, among which 
must be commerce and economic opportunities. The ethnic diversity in this region 
means the diversity of custom, cultural and religious practices that are 
sometimes in conflict with one another. Such conflict has often found expression 
in the political rhetoric within and outside the geo-political zone.</p>
<p>We will now briefly consider them:</p>
<p>1.<b> <u>Minority Politics and the Agitation for Middle Belt Region</p>
</u></b>
<p>Before and during independence, many political leaders of this region, such 
as the late Joseph Tarka, pressed for a Middle Belt region to be carved out from 
the then Northern Region. Their arguments were based almost entirely on two 
factors: ethnicity and religion. They felt that the people of this region, being 
largely Christians and traditional religious practitioners, had little in common 
with the dominant Hausa/Fulani who are mainly Moslems. They felt that a region 
of their own would afford them the opportunity to develop at their own pace and 
in accordance with their cultural and religious practices. There were similar 
agitations in the then Eastern and Western regions. The Western Region gave in 
and created the then Mid-West region was carved out of it. The powers that be in 
the northern and eastern region took a different political view of the 
agitations and refused to yield.</p>
<p>Before independence in 1960, the British colonial authorities responded to 
these minority fears with the setting up of the Wilkins Commission. The colonial 
administration accepted the recommendation of the commission that the problems 
of the minorities would best be solved through administrative actions rather 
than through the creation of more regions. They might have been right but 
contemporary developments soon showed that the British were too trusting in the 
capacity of their indigenous successors to be truly accommodating as far as this 
issue was concerned. </p>
<p>The struggle for a Middle Belt region introduced a thin religious divide 
among the people. Christians largely led the movement for the Middle Belt 
region. In the course of the struggle, the leaders felt that the Moslems in the 
region did not support them in their struggle. They also felt and indeed, 
claimed that the powers that be in the region punished the leaders and 
supporters of the movement but rewarded those who were opposed to it. Thus from 
the early years of the struggle, religion increasingly became a factor. The 
suspicion that particular ethnic groups such as the Hausa/Fulani and the Nupe 
were opposed to the struggle and that their alleged stand gained them favoured 
status in the Northern Region created a latent division and animosity among the 
other tribes. This suspicion was fuelled by the fiery political rhetoric of the 
leaders of the movement and took hold of the psyche of the people. In spite of 
the various political and administrative changes in the region, this mutual 
suspicion has refused to die.</p>
<p>There was one other dimension to the politics of minority in the period under 
consideration. Through the indirect rule system introduced by the colonial 
authorities, the emirs and chiefs wielded considerable power which they 
exercised, sometimes capriciously and alienated some of their subjects. This was 
the case in the southern part of what is now Kaduna State known then as Southern 
Zaria where the Emir of Zaria by virtue of the emirate system, appointed 
district and village heads for the communities as was the practice in most parts 
of the then northern region. But the Southern Zaria communities, who are largely 
Christians and animists, did not feel comfortable with this. They suspected that 
the appointment of Moslem district and village heads was part of an alleged 
grand plan to Islamize them. This suspicion simmered and finally boiled over 
into the Zangon-Kataf violent clash in the eighties. One is aware that the 
Kaduna State government has taken some measures to address this problem but 
mutual suspicion remains largely as a consequence of years of political 
shenanigans.</p>
<b>
<p>2. <u>Politics of Ethnicity/Land</p>
</u>
<p></b>The creation of states between 1967 and 1996 sought to address the 
problem of domination and marginalisation. It was supposed to free the minority 
ethnic groups from the long shadows of the majority tribes. However, with each 
attempt to solve this problem through administrative fiat came new problems. 
Under the twelve state structure of the Yakubu Gowon administration from 1967 to 
1975, Benue and Plateau provinces formed Benue-Plateau State; Kaduna State was 
part of the then North-Central State made up of Zaria and Katsina provinces; 
Niger State, which is not part of this piece, was part of the then North-Western 
State. In 1976, the Murtala administration created more states. The old Benue 
province minus Wukari, Nasarawa and Lafia divisions but plus the old Igala 
division, became Benue State. Nasarawa and Lafia divisions were merged with 
Plateau State to ensure national unity according to the government. Wukari 
division was merged with Gongola State. Thus for the first time since provincial 
administration was introduced by the colonial authorities in 1926, people who 
had lived together for so long under one provincial administration, were 
separated. Creation of more states in 1991 and 1996 pulled the tribes further 
apart. Tied in with this was the creation of more local government areas in all 
these states. The consequences of these administrative actions were the same, as 
will be shown hereunder.</p>
<p>The immediate consequences of what was thought to be <i>the</i> solution to a 
lingering political problem of domination were:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>1. New majority tribes emerged from among the minority tribes. Thus the 
    Tiv in Benue and the Jukun in Taraba states became the new majorities in 
    their respective states. When new majorities emerge, they drive new 
    minorities crazy and fresh agitations for elbowroom on both sides inflame 
    passion, giving rise to suspicion. The desire to protect ethnic rights in 
    the new administrative set up soon becomes a serious problem and the 
    agitation for new political/administrative arrangement starts all over 
    again.</p>
    <p>2. Stranger elements or better known as non-indigenes became a factor in 
    the states. For instance, the Tiv in Nasarawa and Taraba states found 
    themselves regarded as strangers or settlers in those states. Ironically, 
    however, the Gwari do not have the same problem in Niger, Kaduna and 
    Nasarawa states. But the Hausas in Jos have the same problem as the Tiv. We 
    will deal with the possible reasons for lack of uniformity in the treatment 
    of 'strangers' later in this write up.</p>
    <p>3. Closely connected with the problem of settler element is the land 
    question. Some of the ethnic conflicts in the North-Central zone have been 
    over farm and grazing land. Where farmland is scarce, &quot;strangers&quot; who are 
    farmers have problems. When the various states were part of single 
    administrative units, the struggle for land among the tribes was not as 
    vicious as it became soon after the states and local governments were 
    created.</p>
    <p>4. Politics is a game of number but it is also, more importantly, a game 
    of financial muscle. Thus, in some of the states covered in this write-up, 
    the majority tribes are not necessarily the kings or the king-makers because 
    they lack the financial muscle to exercise the kind of influence they 
    should, given their numerical superiority. Where number is marginalized by 
    money, there is bound to be problems. This is the case in Kaduna and Plateau 
    states. It is also the latent fear in Taraba and Nasarawa states; the 
    suspicion being that the Tiv are muscling in with number and financial 
    resources and if they are not checked it would be a question of time before 
    they do to the 'indigenes' what the washer man's donkey did to him.</p>
    <p>5. The chieftaincy institution is a closely guarded one throughout the 
    northern states. The creation of state and local government invariably led 
    to the whittling down of the powers of the paramount rulers in these states. 
    Such loss of territory was never going to be taken lightly. It never was. 
    This was the case in Kaduna, Plateau and Nasarawa states. Equally important 
    is the fact that the creation of new chiefdoms gave rise to agitations by 
    groups that were hitherto marginalized to be part of the chieftaincy 
    institution. The indigenes try to prevent this. Again, we find this problem 
    in Nasarawa where the Tiv insist on some chieftaincy rights with the other 
    ethnic groups.</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The creation of states and local government has thrown up new inter-ethnic 
problems and exacerbated lingering ones. This, however, is not an argument 
against the creation of states and local governments. We seek here to draw 
attention to the fact that these administrative changes in themselves failed to 
engender trust and unity either because of the way the struggle was waged or 
because of the absence of certain factors that make for communal and 
inter-ethnic harmony. We will now turn our attention to these briefly.</p>
<u><b>
<p>Poverty </p>
</b></u>
<p>The North-Central geo-political zone with minimal economic opportunities is 
arguably the poorest zone in the country. There are no major industries in the 
zone. The textile industry in Kaduna once absorbed thousands of unskilled and 
semi-skilled labour from this zone. Unfortunately, most of these textiles 
companies have gone under, thus aggravating the unemployment situation in the 
North-Central zone. Benue Cement Company Plc is virtually the only major 
industry in the zone. This company has itself been in distress for sometime now.
</p>
<p>Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Company, which would have been the biggest industrial 
establishment in the region with multiplier effects on the economy and social 
development of the North-Central zone in particular, has been frustrated and 
abandoned for several years now. No credible explanation has been given for the 
dismal failure of this project, which was expected to be the pillar of Nigeria's 
industrial development. One notes the current efforts by the Obasanjo 
administration to reactive this very important project. We must encourage this 
effort and ensure it is sustained until it bears the desired fruit in the 
interest of the North-Central zone in particular and the nation in general. </p>
<p>The North-Central zone is blessed with agricultural and mineral resources not 
available anywhere else in the country. How can a region so potentially rich be 
so actually poor? Rightly or wrongly, opinion leaders from this zone suspect 
that the non-exploitation of these solid mineral resources is a deliberate plan 
to keep their people permanently poor and deprived. They may have a point. Under 
the laws of the federation, all mineral resources are vested in the federal 
government. State governments have no legal rights to exploit them even if they 
have the means to do so. The full exploitation of our solid mineral resources 
would help to diversify the country's revenue base. We do not advocate resource 
control. <b>BUT</b> we do advocate resource exploitation by state governments 
where the federal authorities are found to be tardy. The economic empowerment of 
our people depends on the full and commercial exploitation of the mineral 
resources it has pleased nature to bury in their land. </p>
<p>Our national target must be the systematic empowerment of the people. The 
poor are vulnerable and are easy targets for cynical manipulation by rich and 
desperate politicians. Miscreants and political thugs are usually recruited from 
among the poor and the disenchanted class. If we close that avenue, we would 
make it impossible for political scoundrels to stir up ethnic conflicts and the 
fortunes derivable therefrom. </p>
<p>One more point. It was fashionable sometimes past to believe and argue that 
the neglect and the deprivation of the zone were a just measure for its people 
who dared to challenge the powers that be in the former northern region. We 
would like to suggest here that it is no longer reasonable to trumpet that 
belief. The creation of states put our fate and our progress in this zone 
squarely in the hands of our leaders, be they civil or military. It is our 
informed view that the officers and men in the armed forces from this zone who 
served in high political offices in the various military administrations had 
ample opportunities to right the politico-historical wrong of the past. We seek 
not to apportion blame but to draw attention to some salient and 
incontrovertible facts in the current political climate as it affects the people 
of this zone. The North-Central zone produced three military heads of state with 
a combined rule of about 18 years. Officers from this region also held important 
political appointments as governors/administrators, ministers and heads of 
government parastatals in the various military regimes. The zone has not fared 
badly either under civilian administrations. </p>
<p>Some of the wealthiest former military men and technocrats are indigenes of 
the North-Central zone. But none of them has a major industrial or economic 
investment in the zone. Ironically, some of these former top military men are 
among the most vocal defenders of the interests of the minorities in the zone. 
We assume that these professed lovers of the zone need to be reminded that they 
have in their hands or rather in their fat bank accounts, the power to change 
the fate and the face of this zone to the joy of all of us. We hereby remind 
them.</p>
<u><b>
<p>Politics</p>
</b></u>
<p>Most of our inter- and intra-ethnic problems have been blamed on the divisive 
politics in our dear country because politics is a game of comparative 
opportunities. Comparative advantages in political opportunities tend to give 
one group or tribe the opportunity to dominate other tribes or groups. It is not 
a crime for politicians to use what they have to gain what they desire. But 
there is a problem when comparative political opportunities are used to 
subjugate other tribes or groups. And then the struggle continues. As indeed, it 
is with the current agitation by some elements from the North-Central zone to 
forge their own distinct political identity. These agitators tell us that the 
Middle Belters, that is people from the North-Central zone, are not northerners, 
a fact, we dare say, is not supported by the political geography of Nigeria. 
This politic of identity is a virulent form of divisive politics. Recruitments 
into this new politics of identity show a very strong but very unfortunate 
religious bias. The new identity of the North-Central zone is being defined in 
religious rather than purely geographical terms, as it ought to be. Air 
Commodore Dan Suleiman from Adamawa State is chairman of the Middle Belt Forum. 
Variants of this forum also exist under various names. The multiplicity of these 
forums in the identity crisis shows that although the Tower of Babel was never 
built, the curse on those who attempted it remains sadly with us to this day.
</p>
<p>The various groups struggling for a distinct identity for the North-Central 
zone are all headed and championed by Christians. If this is a coincidence, we 
must recognize it as an interesting one. Recruits come from states such as 
Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno and Kebbi states which are not by any stretch of our 
geographical imagination, in the North-Central zone. All the recruits from these 
far-flung states are of Christian religious persuasion. Coincidence? Maybe. This 
regrettable development tends to widen the crack in the wall of inter-religious 
harmony in the zone and makes it impossible for the zone to pursue a common 
political, social and economic cause and thus speak with one strong voice that 
cannot be ignored. By excluding people of other religious persuasion, the 
agitators debase themselves and do grievous injury to their cause. We must 
persuade them to pull back from the precipice.</p>
<p>The question may, indeed, be asked: Why does the North-Central need an 
identity? The simple answer is that it is a continuation of the agitation for a 
Middle Belt Region pre-and post-independence in 1960. We have already dealt with 
this earlier in the course of this discussion. What remains to be said at this 
point is that the mindset that infused that agitation has not dramatically 
changed since then despite contemporary socio-political changes that have 
largely responded to that agitation and more or less altered our political 
landscape.</p>
<p>We wish to caution that differences in religious persuasion alone do not 
quite explain some of the crises in the areas of our consideration. The Jukun 
and the Tiv are mostly Christians. If religious differences were the sources of 
inter-ethnic problems, these two tribes would live in total harmony with one 
another as Christian brothers and sisters. Crises in other communities where 
people are of the same religious persuasion show that the bond of religious 
affinity is not often strong enough to hold people together in the unending 
contest for social, economic and political advantages. </p>
<p>Is it possible to minimize the extent to which the haves can manipulate the 
have-nots? It is, provided the poor are empowered and freed from total 
dependence on their rich paymasters. </p>
<u><b>
<p>The Re-emergence of Ethnic Champions</p>
</b></u>
<p>The long years of military rule in Nigeria witnessed attempts to rid the 
nation of tribal or ethnic champions. Rightly or wrongly, our military men 
reasoned that the problems of the first republic which they toppled on January 
15, 1966, were traceable to the emergence of politicians who championed the 
interests of their tribes to the exclusion of others. We are all fairly familiar 
with some of the well-known instances of politicians who, faced with imminent 
political defeat, pulled out the ethnic card and instantly changed their 
political fortunes. The military men tried to discourage this brand of politics 
and politicians. In 1978, the then Obasanjo military administration prescribed 
that a political association seeking for registration as a political party must 
have offices in at least two-thirds of the then 19 states in the federation. 
Both the Abacha and the Abubakar administrations prescribed the same condition 
too. The Babangida administration simply decreed two political parties. This 
form of political engineering was an attempt to distance the new Nigeria each 
regime tried to build through the instrumentality of political association from 
the first republic during which the three main political parties, NPC, AG and 
the NCNC, were regionally-based. The military authorities felt that this 
undermined national unity and made it impossible for the nation to forge a 
common political purpose.</p>
<p>It can be argued that had the military not intervened in the political 
administration of the country, the three political parties might have become 
national parties by now through the formation of alliances across the regions. A 
natural evolutionary process would have thus transformed then into national 
parties bound by common political causes if not ideology.</p>
<p>The most charitable thing one can say about the efforts of the military to 
kill off ethnic politics and ethnic political champions is: they tried. We can 
thank them for trying. In our current <i>post-</i>military democracy, the plain 
fact is that ethnic political champions have re-emerged. Their re-emergence must 
be a source of despair to the gallant military men who took them on. It must be 
and it, indeed, is a source of frustration for the rest of us who expected that 
from the long winter of military rule there would emerge national champions on 
the stage of our national politics. Men and women who are Nigerians and Nigerian 
champions before anything else. The re-emergence of the ethnic political 
champions has undermined all the efforts all these years to re-orientate our 
psyche and promote national cohesion. It may well be that the instrument 
employed by the military to rid the nation of ethnic champions turned out, quite 
ironically, to make the process of their re-emergence possible. National unity 
and cohesion cannot be forced through laws that undermine the natural process. 
Human beings hate to be corralled and/or regimented into conformity. In a 
multi-ethnic nation like Nigeria with varying levels of development or more 
correctly of neglect, any instrument designed to force unity is immediately 
suspect.</p>
<p>What is our current experience? For answer, we invite you to look at the 
proliferation of militant youth groups whose avowed mission is to protect the 
interests of their tribes and those who unabashedly champion their ethnic 
political cause or causes. Odua Peoples Congress, OPC, offers no apology for its 
determination to protect the social, economic and political interest of the 
Yoruba. OPC is more or less the armed or youth wing of <i>Afenifere</i> that 
controls the Alliance for Democracy, AD, the party that controls the south-west 
geo-political zone. </p>
<p>Other tribes and zone took a cue from what is happening in the south-west and 
became persuaded that ethnic championship must be the current going political 
concern. The Igbo have Ohaneze which seeks to advance and protect the political 
and other interest of the Igbo. Its own militant wing, Bakassi Boys, which, 
unlike OPC, is mired in controversy among the Igbo themselves, was ostensibly 
founded to combat robbery and other violent crimes in the South-East 
geo-political zone. </p>
<p>In the former northern region, we have the Arewa Consultative Forum, which 
seeks to speak for the north. Its own militant wing, Arewa Peoples Congress, has 
failed so far to make any impact. But let us not dismiss its potential should 
the need arise.</p>
<p>The oil-producing areas have a good number of militant youth groups sworn to 
the defence and the protection of the peculiar social, economic and political 
rights of their people. The best known of them is MOSOP (for the Ogoni in Rivers 
State) which internationalized the plight and the neglect of the oil-producing 
areas. The Egbesu, a militant youth wing, is the scourge of the oil companies. 
These and other groups seek to determine employment by the oil companies. 
Perhaps, Egbesu and similar groups in the oil-producing areas are not exactly 
the same kettle of fish with the other groups. But we must remember that 
championing the political and other causes of the oil-producing areas has a long 
history that goes back to the middle sixties when the late Isaac Boro attempted 
secession. In our considered view any attempts by some Nigerians to deny other 
Nigerians their legitimate political and other rights in states other than their 
own is a manifestation of the politics of ethnicity.</p>
<p>Our national unity is systematically eroded by the fact that contest for 
political offices has been reduced to primitive struggles among tribes. Since 
most of us appear to have accepted this as a fact of our national life, it 
remains for us to point out the deleterious effect this has on our national 
unity.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <li>1. Tribal loyalty. Tribe was once a taboo word in the 
      politico-military lingo. We substituted ethnic group for tribe � a futile 
      attempt to create neutral word where none would do. The greatest upset in 
      our national development is that the average Nigerian owes his primary 
      loyalty to his tribe and not to his country. The defence of tribe rather 
      than the country appears today to be the primary responsibility of most 
      Nigerians. Nigerians are not loyal to the community in which they live and 
      make a living. They may live in Abuja but still prefer to make their 
      social and other contributions to their own communities rather than to the 
      Abuja community. The excuse which may be valid in some cases, is that 
      since they are not entitled to anything from their host communities, they 
      owe them no social obligation either. The indigene-non-indigene argument 
      is centred on this very argument. The indigenes in turn argue that since 
      they have nowhere else to go they cannot allow settlers to enjoy the 
      better of two worlds.</li>
      <li>2. Contest for political offices at the local and national levels is 
      ethnically-based. Agitation by tribes to produce a Nigerian president does 
      nothing but grievous harm to the concept of national leadership. A 
      Nigerian leader must necessarily come from a tribe but a tribal champion 
      who becomes a Nigerian president is not the kind of Nigerian leader 
      Nigerians should hunt for. The same thing should apply in the states as it 
      affects the election of governors and local government chairmen.</li>
      <li>3. Restriction on mobility of labour. The protection of ethnic turf 
      denies qualified Nigerians the opportunity of working in states other than 
      their own. Here too we have lost the little gains made in the second 
      republic when, for instance, Governor Mohammed Goni of Borno State, 
      appointed a Yoruba man his attorney-general and commissioner for justice. 
      Borno and Plateau states even had Igbo as chief judges. Benue had a Yoruba 
      from Kwara State as chief judge. Some states prefer to employ Nigerians 
      from other state on contract terms. Expatriates are even preferred to 
      Nigerians in some cases. This is not healthy for our nation.</li>
      <li>4. National Youth Service Corps. This scheme, the longest surviving 
      government programme in Nigeria, was introduced by the Gowon 
      administration in 1973 to expose our young people to the lives and 
      cultures of other Nigerians and thereby engender national understanding. 
      This laudable objective of the NYSC is being systematically eroded by 
      parents, guardians and other opinion leaders who believe that by allowing 
      their children and wards to serve in states they do not approve of, they 
      are contributing to the development of &quot;enemy&quot; tribes. How can we expect 
      to build a united nation when we force our young people to accept the 
      prejudices of their parents and guardians?</li>

<p>Solutions</p>
</b></u>
<p>By acts of omission or commission, ethnic conflicts have become major 
problems in our country today. As we pleaded at the beginning of this 
discussion, we cannot tackle them by mere pious declarations of intent or the 
failure to match words with actions necessary to free our dear country from the 
clutches of political and social retrogression. We face a complex situation that 
is becoming more complicated almost daily. We offer here what we consider to be 
a basic approach to finding a satisfactory solution to the problem of ethnic 
conflicts. They may look even simplistic but we feel that we can only defeat 
this menace by attacking it through its many roots.</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <dir>
      <p>1. Economic Empowerment. The vulnerability of the poor is the number 
      one problem. We recommend a comprehensive economic empowerment of the poor 
      and the economically disadvantaged zones such as the North-Central zone. 
      Employment, industrial and commercial opportunities will deplete the rank 
      of the ready recruits for communal and other conflicts in areas which are 
      prone to them. True human freedom is freedom from want. Such freedom does 
      not entirely guarantee the absence of conflicts but it minimizes them to a 
      manageable level. One notes the poverty eradication programme of the 
      Obasanjo administration as a laudable step towards the economic 
      empowerment of the poor and the disadvantaged. But the federal and state 
      governments need to do more. Poverty eradication is a long-term process. 
      It cannot yield to hand outs from the government. What is required is the 
      deliberate creation of business and employment opportunities for 
      self-actualisation. Although the current wisdom is government divestment 
      from industrial and commercial activities, we believe that the government 
      can and should find a way to encourage the urgent exploitation of the 
      mineral and other resources in the North-Central zone to benefit the 
      governments and the people. There is no reason why solid mineral resources 
      should not enjoy the same status as the crude oil resources. Surely, state 
      governments in the North-Central zone and indeed, in other zones where 
      solid minerals abound, will welcome additional revenue through the 13 per 
      cent derivation dividend from the federation account.</p>
      <p>2. The Indigene question, also known as the non-native syndrome. This 
      is a national problem which is more pronounced in areas where 
      non-indigenes are at the commanding height of the local economy. This was 
      the case in that part of the former Eastern Region that became Rivers 
      State. The difficulty faced by the Igbo after the civil war in reclaiming 
      their landed property was as a result of the resentment of the indigenes 
      who felt that the Igbo &quot;strangers&quot; had unjustly deprived them of their 
      rights to their own land. When the opportunity came for them to repossess 
      their land and the property thereon, they grabbed them with both hands and 
      refused to give them back to their original owners. The feeling by 
      &quot;natives&quot; that &quot;stranger&quot; elements marginalise them, fuels discontent and 
      resentment and ultimately leads to violence against the non-natives at the 
      least provocation and quite often at the instigation of local champions. 
      This problem needs to be addressed constitutionally. If Nigerians continue 
      to be regarded and treated as strangers or non-natives in states other 
      than their own, all our labour for national unity would be in vain.</p>
    </dir>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Air Commodore Dan Suleiman, military governor of Plateau State in the 
      Murtala/Obasanjo administration, proposed that anyone who had lived in the 
      state for a period of 20 years should become an indigene and entitled to 
      all the rights and privileges of the indigenes of the state. His proposal 
      was rejected by the so-called indigenes of Plateau State. Nothing more was 
      heard of it. Without pre-empting the work of the Practice of Citizenship 
      Panel set up recently by President Obasanjo, we call for a constitutional 
      provision which stipulates a residency qualification for all Nigerians who 
      live and earn a living in states other than their own. Since we copied our 
      constitution from the United States, it would be no insult on our national 
      pride if we adopted their own constitutional provision on residency and 
      citizen rights, albeit with the necessary modifications to suit our 
      peculiar national situation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <dir>
      <p>3. State-ism versus Nationalism. As we mentioned earlier in the course 
      of this presentation, most Nigerians owe their loyalty to their states of 
      origin. The nation features in their reckoning only for purposes of 
      sharing either the national cake or when tribal feeling dictates that it 
      is the turn of their tribe to produce the next Nigerian leader. Our first 
      generation of political leaders are fondly remembered as nationalists. Why 
      do our current political leaders take pride in being called tribal 
      champions? Something went wrong. We need to turn the table. States and 
      local governments are mere administrative units meant to facilitate the 
      development of the country. Our nation cannot and must not be subordinated 
      to these administrative units, no matter what importance we attach to 
      them. Perhaps, we need to do something we have always run away from � 
      evolve a national ideology which puts the nation first.</p>
      <p>4. Re-education of the elite. This may sound cynical. But the elite 
      have been accused at several public forums by leaders who should know, 
      that they are the causes of most of our social, political and even 
      religious problems. The re-education of the elite is the education of the 
      masses. Our elite need to appreciate their role in the society as opinion 
      leaders. Those of them who mislead the people for short-term political and 
      other personal gains and benefits must be made to appreciate the harm they 
      do to our collective interests. Our elite must be more positive or at 
      least, less negative in their attitude to national issues.</p>
      <p>5. The Press. The press is a fundamental instrument of mass education 
      or, for that matter, mis-education and misinformation. All our efforts at 
      rebuilding our nation and re-orientating the people would be a massive 
      failure if we failed to carry the press along with us. Like the elite, we 
      believe that the press urgently needs re-education on its approach to, and 
      attitudes towards, issues of grave national importance. A consistently 
      negative attitude by the press has helped in no small measure in fuelling 
      and sustaining ethnic conflicts in various parts of the country. Indeed, 
      some people have gone as far as suggesting that some of these conflicts 
      were directly traceable to the role of the press itself when it built huge 
      mountains out of insignificant molehills. With due respect, we must admit 
      that our press is vulnerable and has consistently been manipulated by 
      crisis-mongers and ethnic champions down the length and the breadth of 
      this country. Such people plant and promote false stories in the press and 
      minor disagreements within and between tribes are unduly exaggerated with 
      frightful banner headlines in the newspapers. We must do everything 
      possible to re-educate the press to see itself as a responsible and 
      critical agent of national stability and brotherhood among the various 
      tribes in the country. It is not an insult and should not be so taken, to 
      ask the revered fourth estate of our dear republic to re-educate and 
      re-orientate itself towards playing a more positive and constructive role 
      in the social, economic and political development of the country. A 
      peaceful, united and progressive country is not unhealthy for the press 
      nor does it derogate from its avowed role as the watchdog of the society. 
      It is time for the watchdog to watch itself and watch the motives of its

<u><b>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</b></u>
<p>We have tried to show in our contribution that ethnic conflicts have a fairly 
long history in the course of our political development as a people. The 
interplay of divisive forces has given mutual ethnic suspicion a new urgency. No 
one expects the years of cynical indoctrination of the people of this country to 
yield to a new climate of mutual trust in one day. It is going to be a long trek 
of a thousand miles through minds confused by deceit and a psyche benumbed by 
propaganda. Let us take the first step on that long trek today and have the 
courage to go on.</p>
<p>We thank you most sincerely for your patience.</p>
