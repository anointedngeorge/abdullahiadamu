		<p align="left"><b>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF NASARAWA STATE, ALH. (DR.) ABDULLAHI ADAMU (SARKIN YAKIN KEFFI) ON THE OCCASION OF NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (NEC) MEETING OF THE SPORTS WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF NIGERIA (SWAN) </b></p>
<p align="left">ON 8<sup>TH</sup> JULY, 2004.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>PROTOCOL</i></b></p>
<p align="left">When we were informed that the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN) had chosen our capital city as the venue for their annual national Executive Council Meeting, we heaved a sigh of relief because our efforts at promoting sports in the state and country will have the opportunity of being showcased.</p>
<p align="left">On behalf of the government and people of Nasarawa State therefore, I am highly honoured for the choice of the state to hold this NEC session. I congratulate you for this sportsmanly decision, fully convinced that many bigger cities must have bid to host this meeting. As we says in sports, might is not always equals to winning. We won the hosting rights because we showed ability and have always shown a commitment to the development of sports and its associated values. It is hoped that by the time you leave Lafia, you would have been convinced and satisfied that you made the right choice.</p>
<p align="left">I understand that the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria was formed in 1964 with the following aims and objectives, amongst others.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The promotion of Sports development through consistent publicity.
</li>
<li>The creation of awareness on the significance of sports in all its ramifications.
</li>
<li>The identification of hidden sports talents from the nooks and crannies of the country.</li>
<li>The provision of necessary checks and balances for meaningful and result oriented sports administration at all levels.
</li>
<li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In fulfilling these objectives, the members of the SWAN are supposed to offer constructive criticisms and proffer solutions for the upliftment of sports and sporting activities generally.</p>
<p align="left">It must be noted in addition, that your role as sports writers goes beyond mere recording of the outcome of various games and sporting activities. It is not just about describing which athlete performs well or poorly in the field of play. It is more important than that.</p>
<p align="left">You are by your position, the opinion moulders of millions of sports loving people of this country. This therefore, presents you with a very onerous responsibility, which obliges you to be objective and patriotic in your service to your fatherland.</p>
<p align="left">It is now common knowledge that sports and sporting activities have become vital political tools and instruments for international diplomacy. This is why you must use your profession to help in building a united and stable Nigeria. You must also use it to project your country internationally.</p>
<p align="left">Because as sports journalists, you are also involved in the political affairs of your fatherland. I urge you to always exhibit maturity and a deep sense of commitment to the Nigerian project irrespective of your background. You will be damn wrong if you think that your profession is only concerned with the growing entertainment industry.</p>
<p align="left">On our part, and as a government of the people which is concerned about the general development of our people, we have given sports a special place in our scheme of things. Our understanding is that a sound mind and a healthy body are a perfect combination for a progressive society. Consequently, the government of Nasarawa State is not leaving any stone unturned towards the realisation of its sports dreams.</p>
<p align="left">This understanding is the driving force for all our actions since assumption of office. We have established a standing football team, Nasarawa United Football Club, which now campaigns in the first division of the professional league. I am also pleased to inform you that owing to our support and encouragement, the team is not only occupying the first position on the league table, but is gunning for promotion to the premier league next season Insha-Allah.</p>
<p align="left">In keeping with the commitment and respect for gender equality, the government also set up a state female soccer team – The Solid Babes Football Club – which also qualified for promotion to the first division after only one season in the second division.</p>
<p align="left">During the just concluded national sports festival in Abuja, the state amassed 9 gold, 9 silver and 7 bronze medals to place 15<sup>th</sup> in the table of medals. This achievement must be viewed in relation to the fact that our state is the youngest of all states in the federation.</p>
<p align="left">On the home front, our efforts to promote sports development led us to the introduction of a number of local championships. These include the All Local Government Football tournament, the Under – 17 football championship as well as all the secondary schools sports fiesta and the tertiary institutions football tournament.</p>
<p align="left">We have also introduced the Nasarawa State Sports Festival, the first of which was staged in April this year. It is also worth mentioning that our commitment to this sector is attested to by the fact that our stadium is currently under renovation and re-grassing.</p>
<p align="left">It may also interest you to note that all facets of sporting activities are being given due attention as much as our resources can permit.. A modern Golf Course has already been constructed by the State Government in Lafia and will soon be ready for commissioning.</p>
<p align="left">The desire of the State Government to establish a football Academy is also in the pipeline and results are expected to be reaped in the near future.</p>
<p align="left">Indeed, one of our greatest problems in this country is the tendency to criticise without proffering solutions. This is why as sports writers, the onus lies with you to chat a new course not only for sports but a collective national development.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour and privilege to declare the full council meeting open. I wish you happy deliberations.</p>
<p align="left">Thank you.</p>
