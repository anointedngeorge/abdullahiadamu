		<h1>TACKLING ETHNIC STRIVE IN NIGERIA</h1>
		<h4></h4>
		
	
		
	
		<p align="justify">My dear people of Nasarawa State,</p>
<p align="justify">The communal disturbances in parts of Plateau State escalated in Yelwa last week. Many people were killed and many more were displaced from their homes. Hundreds of these displaced persons are now in various parts of Nasarawa State. Most of them are taking temporary shelter at Dunama Primary School premises in Lafia. The state government has so far shouldered the responsibility for their basic needs.</p>
<p align="justify">We were truly overwhelmed by the pitiable sight of the helpless men, women and children in the camp. It is impossible for anyone who sees them not to be touched by their plight. Some, if not most of them, are innocent but unfortunate victims of a crisis they know nothing about. They were sucked into it and they have been ruined. They have lost everything they ever called their own. They have lost their homes, their farms and other means of livelihood. They now live at the mercy of Good Samaritans. We share their loss; we feel their pain. However, as bad as their situation is, we must thank God that they were lucky to have escaped with their lives. Hundreds of other people did not. They died in the disturbances. We commit their souls into the hands of the almighty God for a peaceful, eternal rest.</p>
<p align="justify">These disturbances have nothing to do with us in Nasarawa State. We are not in any way involved in them. They are purely the internal affairs of our sister state. But we have been drawn into them by reason of geography. The displaced persons have become our problem as much as they are the primary responsibility of their home state government. It is a burden we bear as good neighbours. Difficult as the situation is, we have only one choice before us; and that choice is to rise to the crisis forced on us at this time. The displaced persons have run to us for succour. This is their hour of need. We must be there for them. We cannot turn them away. We cannot deny them the milk of our kindness. We must share our food, no matter how little, with them. We must spare our clothes so they too can cover their own bodies. We must share our sleeping space with them and bear the inconveniences with grace. They have become our challenge and our responsibility. It takes courage to take on a challenge and it takes commitment to discharge responsibilities. Let us not be found wanting in this great test of our humanity.</p>
<p align="justify">When the first wave of displaced persons from our sister state poured into the state in March this year, the state executive council and the state traditional council took immediate steps to assist them. We provided them with basic relief materials and temporary shelter. We did whatever was necessary to reassure them that it is not in our character in this state to turn our back on those who need our help. Most of them are adjusting to their current circumstances.</p>
<p align="justify">We have similarly responded to this new wave of displaced persons in our midst by meeting their basic human needs for food, clothes and shelter. Obviously, these needs have become greater and put extra pressure on our lean financial resources. But we will give no one cause to say that this administration runs away from its responsibilities.</p>
<p align="justify">You would recall that we used the occasion of the presentation of staff of office to Sarkin Agwada to appeal to the people of this state to come to the aid of the displaced persons. We are pleased to say that you heeded our appeal. We are proud of the response of the traditional rulers, political and community leaders and the people of this state in general to the plight of our unfortunate brothers and sisters. You were generous with your time and your personal resources. All of you made immense contributions and sacrificed whatever you could to make them feel at home. Let me very sincerely thank all of you for being there for these people. We regret that we are compelled to ask you to make further sacrifices. It is neither the fault of the state government nor of the displaced persons.</p>
<p align="justify">We have further directed Local Governments and Traditional rulers to launch relief funds in their various domains to enable their residents donate and contribute toward the welfare of displaced persons. We urge all well-meaning citizens and organisations to contribute in cash and kind to help the unfortunate victims of this crisis.</p>
<p align="justify">Our hope when the crisis first erupted in March was that it would be resolved soon and the condition in the communities concerned would be made conducive for the displaced persons to return home. Unfortunately, this did not happen. The situation has worsened in the affected areas, particularly Yelwa, Shendam and Garkawa. The future of these displaced persons is uncertain. Some of them may choose to settle down among us; others may wish to return home as soon as the situation permits. Whatever the choice they make, and it is their right to make choices that are in their best interests, our moral obligation is to assist and be there for them.</p>
<p align="justify">Even as we welcome them with open arms, our earlier warning bears repeating. We will not allow anyone or a group of persons to take advantage of our hospitality to cause disaffection between the governments and the people of Nasarawa and Plateau states. Let me make it abundantly clear that the displaced persons will not be allowed to use any part of the state as a launching pad for retaliatory attacks against their opponents back home. All of them must remain law-abiding. Their current situation does not give them any special right to live outside the laws of the land.</p>
<p align="justify">We once more appeal to hamlet heads, village heads, district heads as well as emirs and chiefs to assist the state government with the basic census of all the displaced persons in their domains. This is necessary to help us plan for their welfare.</p>
<p align="justify">It is most regrettable that communal crises have become festering sores in various parts of the federation. We, in this state, have had our share of the crisis. Happily, we have put that ugly past far behind us. But these crises have more or less become a perennial feature in some states of the federation. Hundreds of lives and unquantifiable private and public property have been lost to these crises. These crises portend danger for our dear country. Our country cannot develop in a crisis situation. Every crisis, no matter how small, takes something away from our progress as a people and as a country. In the last five years, President Olusegun Obasanjo has spared no efforts in trying to woo foreign investors to our country. But these crises cast a long shadow on his efforts. They scare away foreign investors. We and our country are the losers.</p>
<p align="justify">It is for this reason that we make a special appeal to both the president and the federal government to view each communal crisis as an emergency situation that must be contained and resolved within the shortest possible time. It should be possible for the federal and state governments to put in place a mechanism for an early and prompt response to communal, ethnic or religious grumblings and thus prevent the disaffected groups from reaching for their guns, knives and other dangerous weapons. The will to solve the problems that give rise to their conflagrations must be found because we cannot go on this like. Human life is God’s greatest gift to mankind. These crises cheapen this great and divine gift. A nation that does not respect the sanctity of human life has but a shaky claim on civilisation.</p>
<p align="justify">Since our return to democratic rule in 1999, the nation has unfortunately witnessed recurring communal violence. Most of the causes of these crises were inherited from previous military administrations. Unfortunately, we have not been able to find a lasting solution to these problems and thereby secure the lives of innocent citizens.</p>
<p align="justify">One area that we have failed to address is our inability to bring the sponsors of these crises to justice. It is often the ordinary people who are victims that are arraigned before the law courts. The big shots behind most of these crises appear to be above the law. Until we summon the courage to bring sponsors of communal violence to justice, this nation will continue to be held ransom by powerful cliques who sponsor and sustain communal violence across the country.</p>
<p align="justify">We sympathise with the government and people of Plateau State over the continuing crisis in the Jos, Wase, Langtang and Shendam areas of the state. The wanton destruction of lives and property in the state is a heavy loss to all of us. Plateau State earned its just reputation as a haven of peace and peaceful co-existence. It is sad that this enviable record is being allowed to be destroyed by the fire of ethnic intolerance and misunderstanding. The crisis is an ill wind that blows no one any good. Any parties to the crisis which believe they are winning are deceiving themselves. No one is a winner. Everyone is a loser.</p>
<p align="justify">The state government must find a lasting solution to the crisis. Its resolution, no matter what has given rise to it, is certainly not beyond the state government. We want to see a peaceful Plateau State again. But the state government cannot wish for peace. It must work for peace.</p>
<p align="justify">Attempts being made by some elements to give the ethnic cum communal crisis a religious coloration must be nipped in the bud because it is a dangerous dimension. The crisis has nothing to do with religion and those who are trying to portray it as such know that only too well.</p>
<p align="justify">We wish to assure the government and people of Plateau State that as brothers, we are willing and prepared to do whatever is required of us to assist them in bringing peace to Wase, Shendam, Yelwa, Shamakar, Garkawa and other parts of the state which have become hostage to communal violence.</p>
<p align="justify">My dear people of Nasarawa State, these are truly trying hours for us. We must bear this burden with grace and fortitude and pray to the almighty God to hasten the return of peace to the troubled parts of Plateau State.</p>
<p align="justify">Thank you and good night.</p>
