<p align="justify">The Deputy Governor of Nasarawa State;<br />
The Hon. Minister of Science and Technology;<br />
The Hon. Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly;<br />
My Lord, the Chief Judge of Nasarawa State;<br />
The Grand Kadi, Nasarawa State Sharia Court of appeal;<br />

Gentlemen of the Press;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
<br />
I am delighted to receive and welcome you all, distinguished Scientists, Technologists, operators in the science and technology sector and guests to our dear Nasarawa State.</p>
<p align="justify">Your choice of the theme for this year’s Council meeting, "Promotion of Science and Technology through the concept of Technology Incubation and Science Parks (TICs STPs)" underscores our nation’s desire for self-reliance and enhanced capacity to manage our human and material resources to the benefit of our country and humanity at large.</p>
<p align="justify">The Technology Incubation Centre (TIC) concept is globally recognized as offering one of the most reliable options of sustainable development of the resources of a nation. We see this option being actively promoted in both the developed and developing countries. This platform is generally acknowledged to offer an ideal launch pad for Science and Technology to develop, maintain and maximize sustainable wealth creation, poverty reduction and quality livelihood of the people.</p>
<p align="justify">Honourable Minister, I commend your vision as reflected in the theme of this meeting and your energy, drive and determination to solidly register Science and Technology as our nation’s engine of growth in line with modern global trends. The government and people of Nasarawa state pledge their total support for this vision and mission, which you are spearheading in the interest of the present and future generations of our people.</p>
<p align="justify">Hon. Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me use this opportunity to put it on record the appreciation of the Government and people of Nasarawa State for the developmental efforts of your ministry and to assure you that we fully identify with the landmark successes of your Ministry. We are particularly proud and delighted with such scorecards as:</p>
<ul>

<li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
</li>
<li>The launching of Nigeria Sat-1;
</li>
<li>The mobile International Unit and overall awareness and development in the Information Technology (IT) sector,
</li>
<li>The new outlets for cassava in the baking and confectionery industry;
</li>
<li>New developments in local alternatives for the construction and building industry;
</li>
<li>Development of biodegradable pesticides and environmentally friendly organic fertilizer;
</li>
<li>Local capacity for laboratory glassware, science kits and basic scientific equipment; and
</li>
<li>Total local sourcing of low-tension ceramic electrical insulators and several others.
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">It is in the light of these achievements that I would like to extend to you our hands of friendship and partnership in the scientific development of Nigeria. Our first step in this direction was our readiness to host this meeting. I want to assure you that for as long as this meeting lasts, we will endeavour to extend our hospitality and cooperation to all attendees.</p>
<p align="justify">As at now, the most visible presence of your Ministry in our State is the Liaison Office of the Raw Material, Research and Development Council (RMRDC). We would like to feel more of your presence by way of setting up Technology Incubation Centers (TICs) and pilot plants here in Lafia. Let me quickly add that our administration is committed to providing you with all the necessary assistance for the take-off of viable and successful TICs and pilot plants in the State.</p>
<p align="justify">Nasarawa State is endowed with large-scale production of groundnuts, cassava, yam, various cereals and a rich variety of fruits. Cottage industries based on cassava starch, chips, and chemical derivatives of starch will do very well in this State.</p>
<p align="justify">It is also pertinent to inform this august gathering that Nasarawa State has some of the largest deposits of Salt in Nigeria. Our traditional salt industries date back to the history of settlement of our people in this land and they are still thriving today. As most of you may be well aware we are also rich in a variety of mineral resources such as tantalite, barite, gemstones, coal, tin, casiterite, garnet, topaz and several others. Your Ministry can assist us in our desire to establish cottage and small scale processing industries for these resources. We will be glad to get assistance from some of your parastatals notably, the Raw Material Research and Development Council (RMRDC), National Research Institute for Chemical Technology (NARICT), and National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP) to develop small-scale industries for brown sugar production and modernization of the traditional processes of salt production.</p>
<p align="justify">Honourable Minister, distinguished guests, permit me to state that Nasarawa State is at the forefront of implementation of service reforms in the Information Technology (IT) Sector. We already have a state website and are in the process of gradually computerizing our entire public service. Our nine specially designated science schools are also being equipped with computers as the first stage in an aggressive pursuit of computer literacy with a view to making most of our science students acquire the international computer skills.</p>
<p align="justify">My dear Honourable Minister, permit me to once more say that Nasarawa State Government places a premium on Science Education and would like to express her desire to partner with your Ministry in using the Mobile Internet Unit (MIU) to promote computer literacy in our Secondary Schools and rural communities. This is a very important area where we can have very fruitful collaboration with your Ministry.</p>
<p align="justify">Honourable Minister, distinguished members of the National Science and Technology Council, while acknowledging that the list of the various roles that Science and Technology can play in our national development is virtually inexhaustible, let me end by wishing you very fruitful deliberations with assurances of the readiness of the Government and people of Nasarawa State to make sure that your stay in our state is a memorable one.</p>
<p align="justify">Once more, I say a big thank you for holding the 9<sup>th</sup> Council meeting in Nasarawa State. May God, in His infinite mercies bless you for your services to the fatherland and see you safely back to your destinations.</p>
<p align="justify">It is now my privilege and honour to declare open the plenary sessions of the 9<sup>th</sup> council on science and technology open.</p>
