		<p align="left">Address by His Excellency, Alhaji (Dr.) Abdullahi Adamu (<i>Sarkin Yakin Keffi and A’are Obateru of the Source</i>), Executive Governor of Nasarawa State, on the Occasion of the Inauguration of the Implementation Committee for the Free Basic Obstetric Care Scheme, Lafia, Friday, September 23, 2005</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is with great delight that I address you today on the occasion of the inauguration of the Implementation Committee for the Free Basic Obstetric Care Scheme that is about to be introduced in the State.</p>
<p align="left">It would be recalled that while addressing the annual convention of the National Council of Women’s societies, Nigeria (NCWS) held in Lafia from 21<sup>st</sup> – 24<sup>th</sup> July 2005, I pledged that the State Government will introduce the provision of Free Basic Obstetric care for all Women in Nasarawa State as from 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2005. The inauguration of the Implementation Committee today comprising of medical experts, women representatives and other stakeholders is in fulfilment of the promise we made in July, 2005. We believe that our word is our bond.</p>
<p align="left">In response to the ideals of the United Nations approved Millennium Development Goals which makes provision for adequate health care for citizens by the year 2015, this administration has continued to accord the health sector top priority in our socio – economic reform and development agenda. Accordingly, Government has embarked on numerous health improvement projects ranging from the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing health facilities, construction of new ones, supply of modern hospital equipment and the recruitment of requisite health professionals including consultants and specialist doctors in various fields of medicine. Besides, we have continued to ensure the provision of essential drugs in our public hospitals and health centres in order to maintain a sustainable drug supply chain through an effective Drug Revolving Fund Scheme.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In the area of disease control, we have continued to make efforts at combating communicable and child killer diseases through polices that are tailored towards access to medicare for the most vulnerable groups in the society. For example, we have stepped up the distribution of insecticide treated mosquito nets free of charge to pregnant women and children under the age of five in our bid to roll back malaria. In collaboration with the ERCC health authorities, we are building two tuberculosis wards for patients at Alushi medical center. Government will adequately stock the TB center with drugs for free treatment of TB patients once the construction of the ward is completed. Government has also made financial investments in the procurement of necessary vaccines for the eradication of Polio and other vaccine preventable diseases.</p>
<p align="left">In our bid to reduce infant and child mortality rates, Government has piloted the introduction of the school feeding programme. The school feeding programme is intended to specifically prevent and correct known nutrient deficiencies amongst pre-school and school going children, namely Iron deficiency and Iron deficiency Anemia, Zinc deficiency, Iodine deficiency and Vitamin A deficiency. The <b>U</b>ltra <b>H</b>igh <b>T</b>emperature treated (UHT), aseptically packed, 250ml serving which is being administered to all our children in school contains 30 Macro-Micro &amp; Trace Element Nutrients that fulfill the daily nutrient deficit intake of this vulnerable group. All along, Government desire has been to improve the quality of life of our Citizens through the provision of quality, accessable and affordable health care delivery.</p>
<p align="left">Government is by the free obstetrics care programme, commencing a process where the high maternal mortality rates identified as arising principally from pregnancy related causes will be drastically reduced if not eliminated. Statistics from our health centers have continued to indicate that one of the major factors responsible for high maternal mortality in the State is the inability of most women to access adequate medical care during pregnancies due to their poverty levels and lack of funds to pay for medical services.</p>
<p align="left">It is in realisation of this predicament and in a bid to alleviate the suffering of pregnant women in Nasarawa State that this administration has decided to launch the free basic obstetric care scheme. As a start, Government will make Five Million Naira (N5,000,000.00) available to the implementation committee monthly to offset all expenses arising from the ante-natal and post-natal care of pregnant women.</p>
<p align="left">For the avoidance of doubt, the scheme is to cover the entire scope of medicare for pregnant women ranging from registration, investigation including ultra – sound where applicable, provision of routine drugs and surgical delivery as the case may be. In furtherance of our non-discriminatory policies, government hereby directs that the scheme should be accessible to all women irrespective of state or country of origin. However, the scheme will be restricted to Government health Institutions only. Health care provided by private hospitals is not covered by this scheme for now.</p>
<p align="left">The implementation committee which we are inaugurating today is charged with formulating ground rules for the success of the programme. The terms of reference which are listed below will guide the operations of the committee:</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 8em">
<p align="left">a. Work out modalities and issue operational guidelines for the implementation of the scheme in all Government Hospitals in the State.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">b. Ensure judicious utilisation of the funds made available for the scheme.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">c. Develop and apply appropriate monitoring regime for the operation of the scheme.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">d. Undertake periodic assessment and evaluation of the implementation of the scheme and advise Government on possible areas of improvement.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">e. Submit quarterly report on the implementation of the programme.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p align="left">The members of the Committee have been selected purely on merit and on the basis of their proven capabilities to deliver the service required. I therefore, have no doubt that you will all be equal to the task and vindicate the confidence reposed in you.</p>
<p align="left">I wish to urge all hospital personnel to cooperate with the committee in the process of implementing the scheme and avoid any temptation to engage in sharp practices that would jeopardise the smooth implementation of the scheme. Any officer caught engaging in any negative act that could hamper the full attainment of the objectives of this scheme would be appropriately sanctioned and disciplined.</p>
<p align="left">May I use this opportunity to therefore call on all women in the state to avail themselves of this scheme of government aimed at providing basic obstetric care for them during pregnancy. Our gesture must not however be interpreted by the women folk as opening the door to a regime of unrestricted pregnancies by women. We still believe that the holistic health of the family unit should be considered in deciding family sizes.</p>
<p align="left">On this note, it is my pleasure to formally inaugurate the Implementation Committee for the Free Basic Obstetric Care programme, which will take effect from Saturday, 1<sup>st</sup> October, 2005 all over the State and to urge women to go to any State Government hospital and obtain free obstetric services.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 4em">
<p align="left">Thank you and may God continue to bless our efforts.</p>
