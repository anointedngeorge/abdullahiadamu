<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font size="3"><i><b>TEXT OF THE YEAR 2000 BUDGET SPEECH
DELIVERED TO THE NASARAWA STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY BY HIS EXCELLENCY, THE
EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF NASARAWA STATE, ALHAJI ABDULLAHI ADAMU ON DECEMBER 17,
1999.</b></i></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3"><b><img border="0" src="/images/govbud.jpg" align="right" width="204" height="257">I</b> welcome you all to the formal
presentation of the budget of the government of Nasarawa State for the year 2000
AD. We call it the Budget of Rebirth. We chose the title of this budget
advisedly. Our country was reborn as a democratic nation on May 29 this year.
Its government and institutions at all levels are being revamped and revitalised
to serve the peculiar needs of democracy. Nasarawa State as a component of this
great nation, cannot but be affected by the nation�s mood to put the past
behind it and move on to the next century. Early this month, we launched the
state campaign for national rebirth as part of this process of rebuilding the
nation. This budget will be the fruition of our rebirth as a state.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">But before we go on, permit me to place on
record our gratitude for the co-operation and understanding the executive has
enjoyed from the legislature. We are proud of this cordial relationship between
the two vital arms of government. It demonstrates our maturity. Perhaps, more
importantly, it shows in very clear terms that both arms of the state government
are committed to a good, responsible and responsive governance and to the
upliftment of our people. Incessant crises in the executive and the legislative
arms of the governments of other states in the federation and the total absence
of same here, tell us how wisely the people of this state made their choice of
their representatives at the polls. We are more than lucky. We are blessed with
mature and patriotic men and women. We thank God.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">As we have had occasion to point out, we were
elected by the people to serve them. In everything we do, we must never lose
sight of the fundamental principle of democracy, and that is an election
represents the people�s investment in their representatives. The people expect
something in return for the privilege it has pleased them to give us at the
highest level of government. Let us remember, therefore, as we take our state to
the next century and the beginning of the new millennium, that the present and
the future of our state are in our hands. Let us remember that at the end of the
day, we must individually and collectively account for our actions and deeds. It
is my sincere prayer that our honesty and integrity will be eloquent witnesses
to our service in the executive and the legislative arms of the government of
Nasarawa Sate. Mr. Speaker, honourable members, we salute you.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, distinguished and honourable
members of Nasarawa State House of Assembly, before I delve into the broad
details of our budget, permit me to say a few words that I hope will put in
proper perspective, what the Budget of Rebirth is all about. Our budget proposal
has been carefully tailored to perform two vital functions for our state and its
people. It will mark a watershed in our social contract with the people. Its
faithful implementation will help to lift our state and its people to new
heights of social and economic progress and development in the new millennium.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We are not before this honourable house as
part of the ritual of government at this time of the year. We have come with a
higher sense of purpose than to merely walk along the well-trodden path of
budget rituals. We have come to present the budget of the people by the people
for the development of the people. Our Budget of Rebirth encapsulates the
aspirations of our administration. Our total budget proposal is certainly lower
than the budgets of several other states. But the figures alone do not tell the
whole story. When you come to consider the budget, we urge you to look beyond
the figures, lean as they may be because, standing behind those figures is our
determination to make an eloquent difference in the lives of our people. That
determination is not in any way diminished by the fact of our relatively poor
financial circumstances. Indeed, the less we have the greater the challenge for
resourcefulness.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">This budget is unique in at least two
important respects. It is the first budget by a democratically-elected
government in this state. It is, therefore, not a product of arbitrary decisions
and empty promises intended to excite the people. Nor is it a one-man show. On
the contrary, the budget is the product of our collective aspirations as a
government and as a people.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">At the inception of this administration, I
urged all of us in the executive and the legislature to dream together with our
people and with them, resolve to actualise our dreams. In the same spirit, we
have fully involved our people in every process of decision-making. We have
accounted for all our actions and decisions so far to the people. We convened a
summit at which we fully briefed the people of the state. Indeed, we conceived
the summit as a regular forum for a meaningful dialogue between the government
and the people. We are gratified by the response and the contributions to the
first summit. About two months ago, we also organised an economic summit, which
attracted Nigerians from every part of the country. That summit served as an
information vista to the investment potentials of the state. We believe that in
the near future, the state will begin to reap the fruits of this economic
summit.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Secondly, it is the first budget in the new
millennium. It is thus a bridge between the past and the future. It carries with
it the inevitable baggage of past failures in our social and economic
development. And it bears the visions of the new millennium of the government
and the people of our beloved state. Our observation here is apposite. A decade
or so ago, the federal government promised there would be housing for all by the
year 2000. That promised raised fervent hope that all Nigerians would be
adequately and decently housed by the turn of the century. You know only too
that the promise was not kept. To be fair, we must admit there are opulent
houses for the rich. But millions of our people in urban and rural areas alike
are still denied basic shelter, not to talk of decent housing. It is hardly a
good testimony to effective social engineering that millions of Nigerians are
still condemned to live in shacks and huts without the basic social amenities
that make life less brutal and more bearable.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We were also promised health for all by the
year 2000. Again, the promise was not fulfilled. Diseases still ravage the
length and breadth of this country. Health facilities are not within the reach
of millions of our people, particularly in the rural areas. The lack of potable
water forces millions of Nigerians to depend on unwholesome sources of water
supply for their daily domestic and animals. The consequence is widespread
communicable water diseases.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">These are but two cases of the baggage we must
carry into the new millennium. Had these two promises been kept, one third of
our problems as a nation would have been tackled. The implication of this is
that in Nasarawa State, we are forced to deploy our lean financial resources to
fulfill the unfulfilled past promises.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">The Budget of Rebirth is an articulation of
three aspects of the fundamental philosophy of our administration, which are
vision, goals and accomplishments. We anchor the budget on the kind of state all
of us want Nasarawa to be. Our vision for the state of our collective dreams
infused every aspect of this budget. No single kobo in this budget will go out
without accomplishing something for the people. Our goals are realistic,
relevant and achievable. It is important to underline the fact that our vision
and our goals would come to nothing unless there is a determination on the part
of everyone of us in this state, in or outside the administration, to translate
our vision of a better state into reality through hard work, honesty,
transparency and accountability. Our people look up to us to pull them out of
the rut of the unfulfilled promises of the past and set them free on a course of
self-actualisation and meaningful development. We cannot afford to disappoint
them. If we disappoint them, we disappoint ourselves. And if we disappoint
ourselves, we destroy our honour as leaders.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, honourable members, no matter how
carefully a budget is planned and no matter the underpinning philosophy, it
remains essentially a statement of intentions because it is still subject to the
usual human variables or uncertainties. We may get less money than we have
anticipated or provided for. And we may get more money. The variables can pull
in either direction. It is important to bear this in mind when this honourable
house gets down to the serious business of considering every aspect of the
budget.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In the Budget of Rebirth, we expected a total
revenue of about N4,123,281,000.00 (Four Billion, One Hundred and Twenty-three
Million, Two Hundred and Eighty-one Thousand Naira) out of which N3 billion will
be the share of the state from the federation account. Our share of the
value-added tax, VAT, will yield about N450 Million. And from our own
internally-generated revenue, we expect to collect about N620 Million. We have,
therefore, proposed a total expenditure of N4,423,281,000.00 (Four Billion, Four
Hundred and Twenty-three Million, Two Hundred and Eighty-one Thousand Naira) for
the year 2000 AD. This is made up of N1,994,151,000.00 (One Billion, Nine
Hundred and Ninety-four Million, One Hundred and Fifty-one Thousand Naira) for
recurrent and N2,429,130,000.00 (Two Billion, Four Hundred and Twenty-nine
Thousand, One Hundred and Thirty Thousand Naira) for capital expenditures.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">One telling fact of our lopsided national
development is that recurrent expenditures continue to exceed capital votes at
every level of government in this country. All the governments in the federation
spend more money on the payment of personal emoluments and maintaining their
infrastructural facilities than on prosecuting new development projects. This
has been responsible for the near-stagnation or the abandonment of development
projects. We would be saying the obvious in mild words if we say this situation
is regrettable.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Ideally, capital votes should exceed recurrent
votes. But it is one of the unfortunate legacies all governments in the
federation inherited from the past that re-recurrent expenditures always
exceeded capital expenditures. In Nasarawa State, this has been the scenario
thus far. But in this budget of rebirth, and as we move into the new millennium,
we are poised and resolved to reverse this trend. Thus for the first time in the
history of this State, we are proposing a budget in which capital expenditure
exceeds recurrent expenditure. No responsible government could feel that its job
is done merely by reason of its ability to pay monthly salaries and allowances.
One notes, of course, that in the recent past, a government�s ability to meet
this basic obligation to its employees was hailed as a major achievement each
time salaries and allowances were paid.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">It is a truism that the size of one�s
ambition is often limited by the depth of one�s pocket. This is partly true in
our own case. Of course, we would wish we had more so that we can do more. But
we are determined to prove that more money does not necessarily translate into
greater social and economic development. Were it otherwise, our nation, once
awash in petro-dollar, would today present a more acceptable face of development
to the rest of the world. Still, the constraints imposed by a shallow pocket
must not be forgotten.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, honourable members, the cardinal
objective of the Budget of Rebirth is poverty alleviation. We intend to achieve
this laudable objective through the economic empowerment of our people. This
would not be possible without a corresponding investment in all the major
sectors of the economy. We have, however, prioritized the sectors in strict
keeping with the way they impact on the lives of our people. The underlying
wisdom is that this state does not have the necessary financial resources to
pursue every aspect of its development at the same time. We believe it would be
more helpful to the people if government concentrated its energy and lean
resources in developing our social, educational and agricultural sectors in
order to open up opportunities for our people to take advantage of.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We have broadly divided our expenditure into
the following sectors:</font></p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In sub-sectoral distribution, education will
take the proverbial lion share of the budget. It is by far the largest
sub-sector and one that touches on every aspect of the lives of our people. It
is hardly necessary for us at this stage of our development to preach the
virtues of education because we believe no one in this state needs to be
convinced that education is the engine without which modern human progress can
be made. This administration inherited educational institutions in various
stages of dilapidation. Teachers were owed arrears of salaries and allowances.
Their morale, was indeed very low. Our priority in the first one days of this
administration was the full payment of salary arrears and allowances of
teachers. We followed this up with the renovation of classrooms and the
provision of the necessary educational materials and equipment in every part of
the state. These actions boosted the morale of our teachers and renewed their
energy in the service of their pupils. We have not yet reached the ideal
situation but we have sufficiently demonstrated our commitment to qualitative
education in the state. This point is worth noting strongly because the quality
of education or the lack thereof, makes all the difference between educated and
certificated young people. To remedy science education, we have established two
science secondary schools in each of the three senatorial districts in the
state. Modern, global human development is anchored on science and technology.
Our state cannot afford not to be a part of this global event.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Tertiary educational institutions cater for
the products of secondary schools. Nasarawa State inherited a number of such
institutions from the former Plateau State. These are the College of Education,
Akwanga, School of Agriculture in Lafia, College of Arts, Science and Remedial
Studies Keffi. To further expand opportunities for higher education for our
children, we have set up a technical committee on a state university. Subject to
the recommendation of the committee, it is our hope that the university will
take off most probably in the 2000/2001 academic year. The committee has been
asked to determine the best way to set up the university, that is, either as a
single or a multi-campus institution. Furthermore, the necessary groundwork for
the establishment of a State Polytechnic during the physical year 2000 is being
worked out.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">The condition in which we met our secondary
schools was so deplorable that they were hardly producing any qualified
candidates for admission into universities and other tertiary institutions. We
are also resolved to cogently address this situation. Consequently, in the
course of year 2000, government will implement the following programmes to shore
up the condition of our secondary schools � the supply of science textbooks to
students, the massive rehabilitation of dilapidated physical structures,
procurement of science equipment for various schools in preparation for the
take-off of computer education in the State. In addition to this, we have
proposed the establishment of three vocational training centres (one in each
senatorial district) in the State. Technical education shall also receive the
desired boost. Government Technical College, Assakio, is to be accredited fully,
while efforts will be made to establish two additional technical colleges.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In the course of the year, government will
give proper attention to the welfare of teachers as well as make adequate
provision for the payment of student scholarships.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We would spare this honourable house the
recitation of a catalogue of our achievements in the five months of this
administration. But it is only fair to mention a few of what we have done before
this honourable house. In the area of water supply, we are establishing rural
water supply schemes in Masaka, Assakio, Agbada, Agyaragu, Mararaban Loko Wamba
and Dedere. Work on these projects are either completed or on-going. Beginning
from January 2000, we will commence work to provide water to Tashan Mada,
Gadabuke, Udege, Babaji, Arikya, Odu, Onda, Duduguru and Gitata. There is a
great deal more to be done in this area.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Our ambition is to ensure that at least every
local government headquarters enjoys potable water supply. Our ultimate
objective is to make potable water accessible to every community in the state.
As the members of this honourable house know only too well, effective water
supply requires electricity. The lack of electricity will, obviously, affect
whatever ambition one might nurse in this area. But our determination not to be
deterred by inadequacies in our social system has offered us an alternative in
this regard. We are tapping solar energy for use in our rural water supply
system.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">In the area of electricity and energy supply,
Obi town, Awe and Keana are to be linked to the national grid in the year 2000.
Already, technical experts connected with the project have commenced work. With
the three Local Government Headquarters joing the national grid, all the Local
Government Headquarters in Nasarawa State will have been linked with the
national grid.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">It is significant that we commissioned the
Akwanga General Hospital to mark the first one hundred of days of our
administration. The commissioning of that hospital was a triumph of creative
thinking, the hallmark of this administration. We have similarly rehabilitated
the following hospitals and health centres in the state, that is, the hospitals
at Akwanga, Wamba, Keana, Awe, Obi, Nasarawa Eggon, Keffi and Nasarawa. As we
pointed out earlier, this country failed to meet its promise of health for all
by the year 2000. But we cannot fail to fulfill our own promise to our people in
this regard. Every effort is being made to bring health facilities within the
reach of the people. On this note we have earmarked substantial amount in the
budget to prosecute our health delivery programme in the next physical year.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">We have also tackled roads in various parts of
the state. In particular, we have rehabilitated the following roads, Loko �
Nasarawa, Doma � Agwashi � Rukubi � Akpanaga, Nasarawa�Eggon � Tashan
Mada, amongst others. Our state cannot make appreciable progress if most parts
of it remain inaccessible to the urban centres. We will work hard to open up
rural roads to enhance commercial and social interaction within the state as
well as between Nasarawa and other states of the federation. In the new fiscal
year, we will construct and/or rehabilitate the following roads; Obi � Keana,
Adogi � Arikya; Nasarawa Eggon � Tashan Mada; Sisinbaki � Mama � Kwarra
(up to the boarder with Plateau State); Akwanga � Gudi Station � Kokona �
Agbada � Udege; Nasarawa � Ara; Gitata � Panda � Gurku � Mararba.
These road network cuts across every senatorial district in the state. And in
the spirit of cooperative governance, the Federal Government road between
Nasarawa and Loko will also be fully rehabilitated pending when the Federal
Government is able to take on complete construction of the road.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Our state is the breadbasket of the nation.
Yet our peasant farmers live in abject poverty. They do not get true value for
their labour. While they work, the middlemen reap all the benefits. We have
given a great deal of thought to this and have decided to set up a commodity
marketing company for the state. This company will operate more or less like a
marketing board. The company will buy up excesses of food and cash crops from
farmers. This will prevent the current dumping of food and cash crops owing to
lack of storage facilities. The company will thus intervene between the
middlemen and farmers and help the farmers get value for their labour.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">As you will notice, we have voted we have
voted a substantial amount of money for agricultural development in the next
fiscal year. The bulk of this money is to be spent on areas that will help to
boost food and cash crop production. We are currently wooing potential investors
in the area of agro-industries. We will encourage medium and small-scale
agro-industrial enterprises. This will achieve a two-fold objective. It will use
our agricultural produce as raw materials and thus encourage farmers to produce
more. The industries will offer employment and skill to our young school
leavers.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">One notes that there was no promise of light
for all by the year 2000. Does this mean that our semi-urban and rural areas
must remain condemned to darkness? We find this unacceptable. In order to
ameliorate this situation, we have so far completed rural electrification
projects in Masaka, Uke, Sabongida, Wulko, Agyaragu, and the Makurdi road
junction settlement. In the new year we are proceeding apace with our rural
electrification scheme in the following towns and villages � Duduguru, Gidan
Buba, Mararaba (in Nasarawa Local Government Area), Agwada, Tashan Mada and
Rukubi. We have made adequate provision for rural electrification schemes in the
Budget of Rebirth.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Nasarawa State is the home of solid minerals.
Of what benefit are such resources if they are not tapped or exploited? For
long, this major area of our economy was neglected by successive
administrations. It seems idle to talk about the economic empowerment of our
people when there is so much wealth under our own soil waiting to be tapped.
This government is determined to aggressively pursue the exploitation of our
solid mineral resources. As a first step, we have set up Solid Minerals Company.
This company will undertake a comprehensive mapping of all our solid mineral
deposits throughout the state. With the information collected, it will become
the information bank for potential investors in this area. This is also our own
way of assisting such investors. We save them the time and the expenses of
carrying out this crucial investigation by themselves.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, honourable members, this
administration recognises the place of effective information dissemination in a
democracy. The media of public information provide the government and the
governed opportunities for meaningful interaction. We intend to fully encourage
this in order to involve the people more and more in our decision-making
process. The honourable members of this house would remember that the past
military administration bequeathed to us the construction of the state radio and
television complex. We will complete this complex in the fiscal year 2000. That
administration also bought the title of <i>Nasarawa Newsday</i>, a weekly
newspaper. We are in the process of establishing this newspaper as an effective
medium of public information as well.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">As part of our efforts to open the state to
the rest of the world, we are pleased to inform this honourable house that
Nasarawa State has gone on line. That is to say, it is on the Internet. The
website address, for your information is <a HREF="http://www.nasarawastate.org/">www.nasarawastate.org</a>.
The benefits of putting the state on the Internet are immense. The Internet,
otherwise known as the information super highway, is the greatest revolution in
human ingenuity. Using a combination of computer and telecommunications
technology, the Internet is able to access, provide and disseminate information
to and from any part of the world. The site of the state is a window to all our
potential investment opportunities. Our web site showcases Nasarawa State. We
are proud to be one of the first few states in the federation to be part of this
information revolution.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, honourable members, on my
assumption of office on May 29 this year, I made it abundantly clear that I laid
no claims on monopoly of wisdom. At no time in my electioneering campaign did I
offer myself as the wisest man this state has ever produced. I offered myself as
a selfless servant of the people. I make this point to once more underline the
fact that this administration welcomes and encourages genuine and constructive
criticisms of its actions and decisions. Such criticisms will help to keep us on
our toes. More importantly, they will help to subject our actions and decisions
to the crucibles of public opinion and help us correct course before we go too
far off the mark. Criticisms aimed at denigrating this administration and its
principal officers are both unhelpful and destructive. They should be
discouraged. Our doors are open twenty-fours hours everyday. We encourage people
to walk through them to either seek clarifications on the decisions of the
government or offer their views and suggestions. But let it be understood that
as much as we would like to consult all of our leaders at various levels all of
the time, this may not always be possible all of the time. This should not be
taken as an attempt to ignore or marginalise anyone or a group of persons.
Desirable as such consultations may be, the exigencies of time make them
practically impossible some of the time.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker, honourable members, in less than
three weeks, we will be in the next century. We are gathered here because we are
concerned about what the new century holds for our people. Let us resolve to
play our little part as the leading actors on the stage of the administration of
our state so that whatever losses or deprivation our people suffered in the
dying century will not repeat themselves in the new one.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Mr. Speaker Sir, honourable members, it is now
my pleasure and privilege to formally present to you the Nasarawa State budget,
the Budget of Rebirth, for the fiscal year 2000 AD.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="3">Thank you and may God continue to bless and
guide us all.</font></p>
