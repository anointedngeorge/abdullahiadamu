		<p align="left">SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY, THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF NASARAWA STATE ALHAJI ABDULLAHI ADAMU {SARKIN YAKIN KEFFI} ON THE OCCASION OF THE SIGNING INTO LAW OF THE SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION BILL WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2000</p>
<p align="justify">It will be recalled that on the 20<sup>th</sup> January 2000, I signed into law the State Appropriation Bill for the issue and appropriation of the State Consolidated Revenue Fund of four Billion, Four Hundred and twenty-three million, two hundred and eighty-one thousand Naira [N4,423,281.000.00], made up of one Billion, Nine hundred and ninety four million, one hundred and fifty-one thousand Naira [N1,994,151,000.00] as recurrent expenditure and two billion, four hundred and twenty-nine million, one hundred and thirty thousand Naira [N2,429,130,000.00] as capital expenditure for the current year.</p>
<p align="justify">On the 6<sup>th</sup> September 2000, having envisaged additional expenditure for both our current and capital expenditures and bearing in mind the determination of this administration to tenaciously pursue its policies and programmes aimed at total transformation of the young state and this part of the country that has lagged behind in development for long a time, I presented before the Hon. House a supplementary budget of N2.540 billion ; for the period of July to December 2000, that will supplement both our recurrent and capital expenditure for the year under review accompanied by a Supplementary Appropriation Bill to authorize the expenditures there from.</p>
<p align="justify">It is worthy to note with gratification that the Hon. House after assiduous and exhaustive debates and deliberation approved a supplementary budget of two billion, seven hundred and sixty three million Naira [N2,763,000,000.00] and accordingly passed the Appropriation Bill authorizing the said additional recurrent and capital expenditure for the period commencing from 1<sup>st</sup> July 2000 ending 31<sup>st</sup> December 2000.</p>
<p align="justify">However, the supplementary budget approved by the Honourable House is N.223 billion more than the original estimate presented. The Hon House in its wisdom has charged additional capital expenditure of N.023 billion for Nasarawa State Broadcasting Service where no provision was originally made in our supplementary budget estimate and N.200 billion as additional current expenditure for the State House of Assembly which is intended to take care of the current wage bill provided for by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal commissions approved by the Hon. House.</p>
<p align="justify">Mr. Speaker, distinguished Ladies and gentlemen, with the approval of the supplementary budget of N2.763 billion by the Hon. House to supplement both our recurrent and capital expenditure, our total budget for the year 2000 has increased from N4.423 billion to N7.186 billion made up of N2.958 billion as recurrent expenditure and N4.228 billion as capital expenditure for the year under review.</p>
<p align="justify">Permit me at this juncture, distinguished ladies and gentlemen to express my profound appreciation and gratitude to Mr. Speaker, the House Committee on appropriation, Principal Officers and indeed all the Hon. Members of Nasarawa State House of Assembly for their determination, patriotism, dedication and selfless sacrifice in their legislative functions, which in no small measure has contributed to the sustenance and upliftment of our young democracy in the state.</p>
<p align="justify">The quality of legislation in the House of Assembly and the harmonious and cordial partnership which has flourished between the legislature and the executive arms of government in the state makes it easy for one to come to the irresistible conclusion that the Hon. House is exhibiting high sense of reason and responsive to the socio-economy and political needs of our people.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me reiterate here that we from the executive arm cherish this cordial relationship. It is a common knowledge that in the states where the executive and the legislature arms are preoccupied with friction and primordial controversies, objectivity is lost and development relegated to the background. I am happy that we in Nasarawa State today can proudly beat our chests for the successes recorded so far in the development of our state since inception of this administration. We must therefore not relent in our efforts to ensure that our people derive full benefit of democracy.</p>
<p align="justify">Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, on the 6<sup>th</sup> September 2000 when I presented this Supplementary Bill which I have signed into law today, I made it abundantly clear, that this administration is absolutely resolute in delivering services to our people. I am sure it is now axiomatic that remarkable impact has been made in areas such as opening of rural areas with network of roads, provision of rural water supply scheme, rural electrification of rural areas, expansion of the health care delivery system, as well as tremendous boost to the educational and agricultural sectors.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me restate here once again that the supplementary budget, which I have today signed into law, will be used for the purposes of;</p>
<ul>
<li>
Sustaining and prosecuting our social, economic and industrial programmes contained in our budget of rebirth.

</li>
<li>Meeting our collective aspiration in uplifting our people in the areas of rural development projectsComprehensively addressing our poverty alleviation programme by embarking on projects aimed at creation of job opportunities and boosting our agricultural produce.</li>
<li>Help to lay a solid foundation for the industrial development of our state.

</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">In this way we have no doubt that our people will derive value and full services and benefits of our budget in consonance with the main objectives of this administration. However, it will be recalled also that in my supplementary budget address I express fear of the fact that our financial burden will further increase when the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and fiscal commission determines the salaries and wages of public officers and political office holders. The report of the commission on the subject matter has been received and there is no doubt that our first monthly charge will rise astronomically. I am to say here that government has already taken appropriate steps to study the report with a view to determining the financial implication of implementing the new package.</p>
<p align="justify">Let me use this opportunity once again to remind ourselves that for all of us who are elected, ours is a position of trust, which we have all taken oath to protect, for the benefit of the people of Nasarawa State who collectively elected us. We must therefore continue to work as one indivisible team. Indeed we have both moral and constitutional obligations not to sacrifice or compromise the peace and unity of our people on the altar of flimsy political differences, religious bigotry and tribal chauvinism. We must therefore live exemplary lives and shun any thing diversionary. We must appreciate and learn how to accommodate and tolerate one another as brothers and sisters.</p>
<p align="justify">We have set the pace for good governance and our people have already started deriving the benefit of democracy. I therefore implore all of us to sustain the momentum and rededicate ourselves to the ideals of selfless service to our dear good people of Nasarawa State.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp; Thank you for listening. &nbsp;</p>
