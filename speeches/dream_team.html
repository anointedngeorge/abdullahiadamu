<h2><font size="6">A rejuvenated dream team</font></h2>
</b>
<p><font size="3"><i><b>A speech By Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, Sarkin Yakin Keffi,
the Executive Governor of Nasarawa State, at the swearing in of the
reconstituted cabinet, Ibrahim Abacha Youth Center, Lafia, Wednesday, September
12, 2001.</b></i></font></p>
<p><font size="3">A few minutes ago, you took your oath of office as members of
the executive branch of the Nasarawa State government. I am pleased to welcome
you as members of the executive family dedicated to the progress and well being
of our beloved state. We are now the rejuvenated dream team.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We thank the former commissioners and the former secretary to
the state government for their invaluable contributions to the formulation and
the execution of the social and economic programmes of the government in the
past two years. As men and women who are committed to the progress and the
development of our dear state, we have no doubt that they will continue to serve
the state and its people in their private capacities.<img border="0" src="/images/Dcp_0476.jpg" align="right" width="250" height="166"></font></p>
<p><font size="3">The dissolution of our first cabinet was not intended to show
who is the boss in this administration. It was a calculated course of action
designed to achieve a grand purpose in keeping with our philosophy of purposeful
governance. This administration believes in the concept of rebirth. Routine is
the enemy of progress. After two years in office, we needed to inject new blood
into the administration. We needed, if you like, to recharge our batteries. We
needed to refocus our vision. We needed to pause to regain steam.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The careful composition of the new team is aimed at achieving
these objectives. We have a good mix of the old and the new. In football
parlance, we have brought the Eagles and the Eaglets together. The melange of
experience and youth makes us a formidable team that cannot be shaken by
detractors or diverted from its set purpose of leading our people to the
Promised Land.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">But to play to win, we must play as a team. There is ample
room for individual resourcefulness but there is no room, as I have always
emphasised, for the lone ranger in this administration. None of us has the
wisdom and the strength to go it alone. Our collective wisdom and strength are
the sure fire formula for the modest achievements this administration has made
in the past two years. We must not abandon the winning formula. Whatever
successes we have achieved so far are but a few steps on the long road to the
Promised Land. There are greater challenges before us. We are in this team, I
believe, because we accept to take up these challenges in the true and committed
spirit of dedicated service. Our primary responsibility is to help our people
take their rightful place in the comity of developed societies.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">This administration set out to make and has made, in the short
space of a little over two years of its existence, a world of difference in the
social and economic development of the state and the comprehensive empowerment
of our people. Our foundation is firm and sound. Our sense of modesty persuades
us not to blow our own trumpet. Others are blowing it for us. You would be glad
to know that journalists on their current nation-wide media tour to assess the
dividends of democracy have rated ours as the administration to beat in the
current dispensation throughout the country. We expect the rejuvenated dream
team to beat that record.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">None of us has a private or personal agenda in this
administration. Or, to put it another way, none of us should have a private or
personal agenda, whatever might be our individual political ambition. All of us
must subscribe to the same agenda of this administration. In your assigned
portfolios, your duty is to execute the agenda of the government of Nasarawa
State. These agenda have been articulated in the socio-economic development
programmes of the administration. Despite our exalted positions as commissioners
and special advisers, we remain the servants of the people of Nasarawa State.
Let us resolve here and now to serve them with honesty and dedication.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">It also bears repeating to say that we are not in government
as representatives of our people or our religious persuasion. We are the
representatives of the entire people of Nasarawa State. Our mandate is to serve
them to the best of our abilities; to help to uplift them from the shackles of
under-development; to rekindle in them the light of hope in the darkness of
their ignorance and illiteracy and to be the beacon in their struggle for
economic empowerment and the right to meaningful living. Our people must no
longer merely exist. They must live. Your duty is to make it happen.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">This administration expects you to be loyal to it. Loyalty is
not a twenty per loyalty thing or a fifty per cent thing or even a ninety-nine
per cent thing. It is a hundred per cent thing. We are not asking you to be
sycophants. God knows we can do without sycophancy. The loyalty I ask for does
not suggest that I want you to tell me what you believe I want to hear. Indeed,
there is no greater disloyalty than to deceive or mislead the government. We
must be told the truth at all times, no matter how bitter it may be. Do not be
yes-men and yes-women. You must be men and women of integrity. You must at all
times provide honest and purposeful leadership in your various ministries. Do
not equate integrity with a stubborn adherence to a course of action when
collective wisdom dictates otherwise. Your judgement cannot be superior to our
collective decision.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Loyalty means that you must give all you have to this
administration in the execution of its programmes. It means you must be faithful
to your oath of office; honest in your dealings with the public and transparent
in the discharge of your duties to the government and people of Nasarawa State.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">No human society can progress in an atmosphere of mutual
hostility. We came into office waving the olive branch in all communities across
the state where mutual hostility had held progress and development hostage. We
preached peace and took steps to ensure the return of peace to such communities.
On July 3 last year, the Bassa people who were displaced from their ancestral
land as a result of ethnic crisis between them and the Egbira people in Toto
local government area early in 1998, returned home. The federal government and a
good number of foreign governments commended this unique achievement by the
administration. We believed then that all the ethnic groups in the state must
have learnt some valuable lessons from that crisis and therefore be prepared to
embrace dialogue as the only civilised means of resolving misunderstanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Unfortunately, some evil forces in our midst betrayed our
hope. An unprecedented orgy of violence erupted in parts of the southern
Senatorial District of the state in June this year. A series of inter-ethnic
misunderstanding turned into a gruesome theatre of war. Once again, in the face
of mindless violence and destruction, peace took flight. Innocent people,
including babies, were killed. Valuable property was lost. Farming, the main
activity in that part of the state, was and remains severely affected.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">You would recall that one of the victims was Alhaji Musa
Ibrahim, Sarkin Azara and a member of the executive team as a special adviser.
He was a loyal and dedicated member of the dream team. We pay a special tribute
to him. We will sorely miss his advice, which was always made richer by his dual
role as a traditional ruler and a political leader. We pray the almighty Allah
to grant his soul and the souls of all those cut down in the orgy of violence
eternal rest. May our state and its people never again witness such senseless
killing and destruction.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We are still contending with the problem of resettling the
people driven away from their homes. The crisis has set us back. Those who have
lost homes, farms and other valuable property are forced to begin life again.
The state is forced to spend time and resources in quelling the crisis and
caring for the injured and the homeless. It is a truly painful development.
Nevertheless, it is a challenge for this administration in its avowed
determination to build a united and peaceful Nasarawa State. This is part of
your challenge as members of the executive team. The guns are now silent. The
process of reconciliation and confidence building is in progress. And it is the
most critical period. Frayed nerves must be soothed. People need to be
re-assured that their neighbours are their friends again. We must be prepared to
give this process all that it takes to bring peace back to the communities where
the crisis occurred.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We sincerely thank our traditional rulers, local government
chairmen, the security agencies and community leaders for their support and
co-operation with the government in this unfortunate crisis. We urge them not to
rest on their oars until every displaced person returns home and until all
hostilities cease and peace reigns again in the affected communities.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">You have come on board at a critical period in the life of
this administration. As a government of the people elected by the people for the
people, accountability is a critical element in our contract with the people. We
must be prepared to discharge this critical aspect of our duty to our people now
because we are in the last lap, as it were, of our four year term of office. We
must consistently keep our own part of the contract with the people. We must
neither abuse the trust reposed in us nor serve our individual interests at the
expense of our people. We must continue to build on the foundation we laid in
the first half of the term.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The period we are entering will witness intense political
activities throughout Nigeria as we approach re-election at all levels of
government. Re-election fever is abroad already in every part of the country.
None of us will be isolated from these political activities. After all, we are
all politicians running a political government. However, our primary duty in
this administration is what we make of the mandate given to us by the people. We
must refuse to be distracted by the diversionary tactics of other politicians,
especially those of them seeking power. We must be deaf to the noise of politics
calculated to divert our attention from discharging our responsibilities. Let
our achievements be our testimony before the people.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">As leaders of our people in our individual rights, we will be
increasingly drawn into all kinds of political activities. We may even be at the
centre of some of them. Politics in Nigeria very often degenerates into ethnic
and religious contest. We advise you to resist the temptation, no matter how
strong, to become ethnic or religious champions in the name of politicking. You
must always strive to be champions of Nasarawa State by doing those things that
unite our people. You should avoid, like the plague, those things that divide
us. If our state were not at peace with itself, if our people do not learn to
jaw-jaw instead of war-war and if an easy resort to violence becomes an article
of faith among our people, then we would labour in vain. Our sweat would count
for nothing. And that would be both a pity and a tragedy.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">As political appointees, you must not be isolated from your
people. You must keep in contact with them and lead them along the path of truth
and honesty. Your contact with them will enhance communication between them and
the government. Effective communication prevents misunderstanding and suspicion
and helps to build trust and confidence. Our people need to be constantly
informed and educated about the direction of the government and what we are
doing for them. This task must be left to the state ministry of information
alone.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We make a special appeal to our politicians. Our constitution
guarantees every eligible Nigerian the right to seek an elective office of his
choice. And we welcome all those who would want to seek such offices in the
state. However, in their quest for power, they must not resort to negative or
destructive politics. We will gain nothing from divisive politics in this state.
This administration will do nothing knowingly or unknowingly to prevent anyone
from exercising his constitutional rights to the fullest. We guarantee everyone
a level playing field. For us, politics is not a do or die affair. We sought the
mandate of the people to be given an opportunity to serve them, no more, no
less. We will not use our position to prevent anyone from fully and legitimately
exercising his political and constitutional rights. But the government has a
responsibility to ensure peace and harmony in the state. It will not, therefore,
in the name of democracy, permit anyone or a group of persons to set the state
on fire. Anarchy is anathema to democracy. There is no room for anarchy in the
state. Divisive politics is destructive to our common weal. We will curb it. As
indigenes of the state, we have a collective responsibility to help water and
nurture the young tree of democracy in our state in particular and in our
country in general. Democratic rights can be fully exercised only where
democracy thrives. We must make it thrive.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The creation of more local governments in response to the
yearnings of our people is high on our political agenda. We duly set in motion
the administrative process in accordance with the constitutional provision for
the creation of new local governments. The state house of assembly would have
completed the necessary legal framework for the referendum by now but
unfortunately, the crisis in the Southern Senatorial District disrupted it. We
lost the moment. We have now put the process back on track. We are proceeding
with the administrative process. In the next one month or two, the state
independent electoral commission will announce the date for the referendum. We
urge everyone to ensure the success of this important exercise.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">We are also looking into the issue of creation of new
chiefdoms and the review of the status of existing ones. Our people will be kept
duly informed of this process.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, we, the rejuvenated dream
team, have a big task ahead of us. We cannot accomplish it without the full
co-operation and the support of the people. The crisis has cost us dearly in
time and resources. We must now get back on track to complete on-going projects
throughout the state. I appeal to all our people not to allow anything to divert
the attention of government at this critical time. We must move ahead and we
must do so as one people with a common destiny, the differences in tongues,
religion or political association notwithstanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Let us join hands together, put our back to the plough and
make Nasarawa State the envy of other states in the federation. We have what it
takes to make the miracle happen. Let us go forth now as the soldiers of peace,
as dedicated servants of the people and as catalysts in the vanguard of progress
and development. This is our chance to show who we are and to prove what we can
do as a rejuvenated, recharged and refocused Dream Team. May the good Lord be
our guide.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Thank you.</font></p>
