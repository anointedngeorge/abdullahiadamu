</font></u></b>
<p><b><u><font face="Times New Roman">TEXT OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ADDRESS TO THE SECOND NASARAWA STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY BY HIS EXCELLENCY, THE EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR, ALH. (DR.) ABDULLAHI ADAMU (<i>Sarkin Yakin Keffi</i>) ON TUESDAY, 10</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="1">TH</font><font face="Times New Roman"> JUNE, 2003</font></u></b></p>
<p>After a long spell of coercive military dictatorship, we have every cause to thank God today that Nigeria's regained democracy has stabilised. In the past four years, the three tiers of Government in Nasarawa State have particularly worked in harmony for the good governance of our State. We wish to appreciate the sense of responsibility and patriotism demonstrated by the first session of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, which carried out its responsibilities admirably and to the satisfaction of the entire people of Nasarawa State.</p>
<p>It is on record that unlike the experiences in other States of the Federation, the relationship between the Executive and the Legislative arms of Government in Nasarawa State has been exemplary and cordial. Both arms of Government have respected each other and acted maturely and with responsibility in carrying out their constitutional functions. This maturity and sense of responsibility provided the needed stability without which the progress we made in the last four years would not have been possible.</p>
<p>We wish to express profound gratitude to the immediate past leadership of the Honourable House for its patriotism and foresight in carrying out its functions. The former Speaker, Rt. Hon. Alh. Musa Agyo led the House effectively in a crisis-free atmosphere throughout the first session. We will miss his presence in the House these four years. He is a young man with bright prospects in the politics of our State.</p>
<p>As I have stated repeatedly on several occasions, the understanding and cooperation that prevailed between the two arms of Government formed the basis for the success recorded in the first term of this democratic dispensation in all sectors of the State's economic and social life. Because both the Executive and the Legislature understood their respective roles, the PDP Administration in our State was able to positively affect the lives of our people in education, rural development, health, commerce and industries, information sector, and in agriculture where our achievements have been most manifest.</p>
<p>Today, because of this harmony and consequent achievements, an overwhelming majority in the State has returned the PDP to power. Whereas in 1999 we had four opposition members in the House, today there is only one opposition member out of a House of 24 members in the present session.</p>
<p>It is important that this overwhelming confidence, which the people have demonstrated and reposed in us in the last election, must invigorate our performance through effective delivery and governance in the second term as enunciated in my inaugural address on 29<font face="Times New Roman" size="1">th</font><font face="Times New Roman"> May, this year.</font></p>
<p>Our administration will consolidate on our developmental initiatives in the areas of rural development, agriculture, co-operative ventures, education and healthcare delivery, which will become the main planks for action by this administration in the next four years.</p>
<p>We therefore urge the new leadership of this Honourable House and all members to rise to the challenge of Legislative support to ensure improved performance in our second tenure. </p>
<p>On the part of the Executive arm of Government, we wish to assure our newly sworn-in legislators of our continuous cooperation and respect. We will do everything possible to ensure the smooth operation of the legislative arm of Government.</p>
<p>The Assembly should, therefore, avoid all internal wranglings and rise to the challenges of its legislative functions. Although the opposition in the House has been reduced to just one member, this should not lead to complacency on the part of the PDP majority. In view of recent experience, especially, at the National Assembly where internal dissention and rancour within the majority party generated so much heat and distractions, our Legislators must be vigilant and act with all sense of responsibility and patriotism.</p>
<p>Let our increased majority in the House reflect in good law-making, speedy and constructive passage of bills and the general performance of the legislative arm of Government.</p>
<p>Permit me also to use this opportunity to draw our attention to the intermittent inter-ethnic or communal crises, which interrupted our progress in the first term. The Nasarawa State of our dream can only be realised in an atmosphere of mutual love, peace and harmony between the various ethnic groups in the State. The unfortunate incident in the Nasarawa South Senatorial District, and the protracted Toto inter-ethnic crisis are a reminder that we must all rise to our constitutional duty of ensuring law and order and peaceful coexistence in all parts of the State at all times. The loss of lives and property in these crises and the anguish of communities that were involved in them have disrupted our developmental strides in these areas.</p>
<p>We thank God that sustainable peace has returned to the Nasarawa South Senatorial District. We must, however, continue to be vigilant and maintain the peace in this area. In the case of Toto, this administration has taken firm steps to fish out the perpetrators of violence and crisis in the area. We will press ahead with the current efforts until those involved in arson, murder and mindless destruction are combed out and brought to justice.</p>
<p>Both the Executive and Legislative arms of Government are under oath to ensure law and order, protection of lives and property of innocent citizens, and maintenance of peace in all parts of the State. I therefore urge members of the Assembly to give full support to the effort of Government in maintaining peace and peaceful coexistence in the State. Members must work and act in such a way that will promote peace and inter-ethnic harmony in their constituencies. Without this, the purpose of Government is defeated.</p>
<p>The most important thing we can offer our people is peace and security. We will do everything to realise this in the next four years. No constituency in the State will live above the law or be treated differently if there is any breach of the peace.</p>
<p>Government will do everything possible to ensure a conducive working environment for members of the House. It is pertinent to note that most of the welfare services for members have since been monetised by the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission. This means that the provision of housing, transport and furniture have all been monetised and are now paid along with salaries. Government no longer provides official vehicles and accommodation for members of both the Legislative and Executive arms, and indeed, all public officers affected by the monetisation policy. I wish to assure you that all relevant allowances to which you are entitled will be paid by Government as soon as possible to enable you settle down to your duties.</p>
<p>I congratulate the new leadership and the entire members of the second session of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly on your well-deserved election. Expectedly, most of you are returning to a familiar terrain in the art of law-making, while others are coming on to the arena for the first time. It is my belief that both the 'old' and 'new' breeds will blend your different experiences for smooth operation of the Assembly and rapid development of our young State. I wish you an exciting experience in your political careers.</p>
<p>Thank you and God bless.</p><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>
