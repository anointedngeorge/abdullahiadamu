    <h2><font size="6">Let's Sheathe Our Swords</font></h2>
    <p><font size="3"><i>Being the Text of Radio and Television Broadcast by the
    Governor of Nasarawa State, His Excellency, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, [Sarkin
    Yakin Keffi] on the Ethnic Violence in the State, Lafia, July 2, 2001</i></font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My dear people of Nasarawa State</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I address you at this moment with a heavy and bleeding
    heart. The unfortunate events in our beloved state in the past few weeks
    hardly news to anyone of you. On the 12th of June, the Chief of Azara,
    Alhaji Musa Ibrahim, my special adviser for special duties, was assassinated
    on his way from Azara to Lafia in the normal course of his duty. His killing
    along with six other people, four of whom were traveling in the same car
    with him, was the climax of a series of ethnic violence that has gripped
    some parts of the state since December last year.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">His sad death has exacerbated the inter-ethnic crisis and
    led to what appears to be retaliatory measures between the Tivs and the
    other ethnic groups in Awe, Keana and Obi local government areas in the
    state. Consequently, our beloved state has been convulsed in an orgy of
    inter-ethnic violence. Friends and neighbours have suddenly become enemies.
    Men, women and children have been slaughtered in cold blood. Our state has
    never witnessed this level of violence and savagery before. May it never
    witness it again. People were not just killed; they were butchered. Movable
    and immovable properties of our own brothers and sisters have been destroyed
    or looted. None of us can claim not to have been affected by this spate of
    mindless destruction of lives and property. Hundreds of people have been
    turned into hapless and hopeless displaced persons in their traditional
    homes. Some of us have lost members of our immediate or nuclear families.
    Some of us have lost close friends and neighbours. Most of us are touched
    and saddened by this unsettling development in our beloved state. Nasarawa
    State mourns its sons and daughters. This crude and senseless violence has
    neither rhyme nor reason. This explosion of bottled fury and frustration
    threatens to set us back and retard our progress in the development of our
    state. We must not allow it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My dear people of Nasarawa State, death is painful, very
    painful. The loss of personal properties is no less painful. Our hearts must
    go to all the victims of this violence. On behalf of the good people of this
    state, my humble self, my family and the government of Nasarawa State, I
    send my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families throughout the state.
    We mourn with you. We share your anguish, your pain and your sorrow.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The state has lost some of its old men and women. We will
    never avail ourselves of their wisdom and experience again. It has lost some
    of its promising young men and women. Their senseless killing has deprived
    us of their valuable contributions to the development of our state and its
    people at various levels now and in the future. All of us are losers in this
    crisis. For the death of one man in the Nasarawa family diminishes all of
    us. We must never forget that.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I am touched by these killings. I feel a sense of personal
    loss as governor of this state, as a brother to the old men and women and as
    a father to the young boys and girls so cruelly cut down even before their
    sun had reached the noon of their promising lives. May God grant all of us
    the fortitude to bear the painful and irreparable losses. May their death
    give us the courage to banish inter-ethnic hatred and promote ethnic harmony
    and brotherhood so that ours will become a state in which no one would
    suffer any personal privations by reason of tribe, religion or political
    affiliation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Permit me to pay a special tribute to Alhaji Musa Ibrahim.
    He worked with me for two years as my special assistant on special duties. I
    never found him wanting in the discharge of his responsibilities. He was a
    fine and responsible gentleman. He was a man of peace who was committed to
    peace in his domain. Ironically, he died a violent and painful death in the
    hands of cowardly assassins. I extend my sympathy to his family and the
    people of Azara district.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">As painful as the death of our friends, families and
    beloved ones is, we must accept the obvious. No lives lost can ever be
    brought back. More violence can only mean more deaths and destruction. This
    will serve no useful purpose. It will only increase our collective pain and
    loss and retard the progress of our state. In my inaugural address on
    assumption of office as the first elected governor of this state, I made a
    passionate appeal to all warring groups wherever they might be in the state,
    to sheathe their swords and embrace dialogue as a superior form of civilized
    conduct in a democracy. I said that we could not afford to waste our energy
    in a needless crisis. Let me repeat that appeal. We cannot afford the luxury
    of inter-ethnic violence. Our state requires all the hands of its indigenes,
    and those of all its residents to be on deck for its rapid development and
    the meaningful empowerment of our people. In the two years of this
    administration, we have made giant and incredible strides in the social,
    educational and economic development of our state. Our state is poised for
    the greater challenges ahead. It can only forge ahead in a climate of peace,
    not in a climate of violence and mutual suspicion. We cannot afford to
    squander current opportunities in pursuit of narrow and self-interests. We
    must refuse to sacrifice the little gains we have made on the altar of the
    gods of intolerance and ethnic aggrandizement.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We must rise with one voice and condemn, in no uncertain
    terms, those who are fomenting this crisis and those whose hands drip with
    the precious but wasted blood of the innocent. They do not mean the state
    and its people well. The police and other security agencies have made no
    arrests so far since the crisis began. But the perpetrators of these heinous
    crimes and their sponsors, whoever they are and wherever they are, must not
    think for one minute that they can go Scot-free. The long arms of the law
    will surely catch up with them sooner than later. They will pay in full the
    prescribed legal penalty for their crime against the state and its people.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">To me, Nasarawa State is more than a state. It is a
    family. For the past two years, I have tried to build a happy and contented
    family from the rainbow collection of ethnic groups, united in the cause of
    their collective progress as a people and committed to the ideals of
    democracy and democratic governance. The events of the last few days have
    sorely tested my resolve but they have failed to shake it. Indeed, they have
    strengthened my determination to build a strong, united and prosperous state
    forged from the anvils of our collective pain and losses. I am encouraged in
    this by the tremendous show of support from the entire state and from our
    friends and well wishers within and outside the state. Our state calls on
    all of us at this hour of its pain and loss to rise up now and reject those
    who erroneously believe that their political stars will be polished with the
    blood of the innocent. They will be happy to see the state burn. We must not
    give them that sadistic joy.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We warn anyone or a group of persons who would wish to try
    the will of this administration to desist in their own interest. We are
    fully committed to the rule of law in the best tradition of democracy in
    this state. Anyone who mistakes this for weakness on the part of this
    administration can only blame himself for butting his head against granite.
    We are resolved to protect the lives and properties of everyone in this
    state. We are determined to ensure that disgruntled elements in our midst
    are not allowed to court cheap political popularity at the expense of the
    state and its people by perpetrating and perpetuating a needless
    inter-ethnic crisis. Let it be heard loud and clear that this administration
    will spare no efforts to uphold the rule of law and ensure the reign of
    peace in every nook and cranny of Nasarawa State. We will fish out the
    troublemakers, no matter where they hide, and subject them to the rigours of
    the law of the land. Those who have murdered sleep have lost their own right
    to sleep. We warn those who seem bent on capitalizing on this crisis for a
    cheap political gain to desist forthwith. They will be given no such chance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Nasarawa State occupies a unique position in this country.
    It is a strategic state in the north-central geo-political zone. The unity
    of this zone is crucial to the unity of the nation itself. The current
    political leaders from this zone have worked tirelessly together since the
    return to civil rule, to forge and promote this unity. Inter-ethnic crisis
    such as we are now witnessing in our state does not augur well for the
    much-needed unity in the north-central zone. It is clear, therefore, that
    the sponsors of this crisis in Nasarawa State are so blinded by their
    political ambition that they ignore the larger interests of this very
    important geo-political zone. This zone has always been recognized as the
    vital link in the chain of Nigerian unity. We will be the great losers if we
    allow the termites to eat into the plank of our unity.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We have always taken pride in the fact that our state is a
    replica of the old Northern Region. Almost every tribe in that vast region
    of blessed memory is found in the state. We have the Fulani, the Hausa,
    Igala, Igbira, Tiv, Kanuri, Nupe, and Gwari in the state. Many of these
    tribes have lived in their present settlements in the state for hundreds of
    years. Some of them have established their own monarchies and kingdoms. The
    Tivs were together with us in one administrative unit in the old Benue
    Province since 1926. We were in Benue-Plateau State together from 1967 when
    the state was created until 1976 when Benue-Plateau State was split into
    Benue and Plateau states and the northern part of the old Benue Province was
    merged with Plateau State. They too were part of this arrangement. Can we
    now deny them the right to be indigenes of Nasarawa State? We cannot. They
    have been part of us and they remain part of us. No one can deny them that
    right as indeed, the other tribes cannot be denied their right to be part of
    this state. The Tivs have intermarried with some of the other ethnic groups
    in the state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Admittedly, there have been occasional hiccups in
    inter-tribal relations such as disputes over farmland and grassroots
    traditional leadership between the Tivs and some other ethnic groups in the
    past. Such minor flare-ups were always amicably resolved. No violence on
    this scale we have just witnessed has ever occurred between the Tivs and the
    other ethnic groups in the state. Something must have gone badly wrong
    somewhere to give rise to these brutal and savage killings. It is a
    degeneration of our collective sense of moral responsibility.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We are aware of the vicious propaganda being mounted by
    the enemies of this state who are busy spreading the rumour that the present
    crisis is ethnic cleansing directed against the Tivs. This propaganda is
    wicked, malicious and mischievous. There is no truth in it. There is no
    basis for it. The Tivs, like all other tribes in the affected areas, lost
    people and property in the violence. I appeal to the Tivs to ignore the
    wicked propaganda. It is the handiwork of those elements who are intent on
    destabilizing the state. The state will fully protect them and their
    property, as it will protect the lives and the property of the other ethnic
    groups. They must not allow themselves to be used by those spreading this
    propaganda. More violence will solve no problems. It will only lead to a
    vicious circle of vengeance and more violence whose end no one can predict.
    There should be no further raids and sporadic invasions as were carried out
    at Agaza and Owena in Keana local government area and at Adudu and Tudun
    Adabu in Obi local government area.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">All the tribes in the state are bound together with the
    cord of common destiny. No tribe can be uprooted from here. The Kanuris
    cannot. The Fulanis cannot. The Eggons cannot. And the Tivs cannot. The
    sooner we all realize this the better for all of us. We are all indigenes of
    this state, not settlers. As far back as 1947, a Tiv man was elected into
    the then Lafia Native Authority. He was councilor for police and prisons.
    Many other Tivs were in the employment of the same Lafia Native Authority.
    There were also six village heads of Tiv origin long before Nasarawa State
    was created. In one or two traditional institutions in the state, the Tivs
    are among the kingmakers. This shows quite clearly that we have been
    interwoven as a people for a long time. No one can, therefore, just wake up
    one day and demand that we be separated. It will not happen. It cannot
    happen. Those who advocate separation are merely looking for what they
    believe to be a quick fix and not solutions. The sad and painful events we
    are experiencing today show beyond doubt that their quick fix is not cheap,
    but is dangerous and totally unacceptable.</font></p>
    <font SIZE="2"><u><b>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </b></u></font>
    <p><font size="3">We are aware that this administration has been accused of
    favouring the Tivs. This mischievous accusation stems from the appointment
    of just two persons, two persons of Tiv origin, one as a Special Adviser and
    the other as a Permanent Secretary into the public service of the state.
    These appointments appear not to have gone down well with those who accuse
    the government of favouring Tivs. We crave for your understanding, for what
    we have done. This administration was not the first in the state to
    acknowledge, as any responsible government should, the glaring fact that the
    Tivs are part and parcel of this state. Those of them who have lived in the
    areas that now constitute Nasarawa State are undoubtedly indigenes of this
    state. We cannot, in clear conscience, ignore them. Every ethnic group in
    this state has a stake in it. All of them must be given their due. No one
    can take that away from them. As indigenes, the Tivs are and must be fully
    entitled to their dues like other tribes in the state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I admit that this was not an easy decision for me but I
    know it was the right decision. I took it in the interest of the state. I
    stand by it. As a responsible and committed leader, I must take the
    difficult decisions, however unpalatable they might be, provided I am
    convinced, as indeed I am in this case, that they are fair, just and right
    for the state and its people.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We must find a way forward. That is the challenge all of
    us now face. In the past two weeks, I chose to work quietly round the clock
    to find solutions to this sad conflict. I resisted the urge to rush to make
    a broadcast with uncertain messages that offer no way forward. Today I am
    pleased to report that I have had extensive consultations with traditional
    rulers, the leadership of the civil society, political office holders,
    legislators, and local government chairman particularly from the areas of
    conflict, and with my colleague and brother, the governor of Benue State,
    Mr. George Akume, accompanied by the Tor Tiv, top government functionaries
    and community leaders from Benue State. These consultations have been very
    fruitful and helped chart a course out of this crisis. I am happy to say
    that the consensus of opinion from these consultations is that there is room
    for dialogue. Killings and violence do not end crisis. They exacerbate them.
    Yet in the end, people must come to the round table to sort out their
    differences. It is better, therefore, to accept the round table as the first
    rather than the last option. As a first option, it will prevent killing and
    destruction and the hardening of positions and emotions.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In all these series of consultations with our community
    and opinion leaders and with the Government and opinion leaders of Benue
    state, it was unanimously agreed that for any meaningful progress to be made
    along the path of peace and reconciliation, all the warring communities must
    ceasefire and sheath their swards. The ceasefire is to be observed in all
    the feuding communities immediately and without exception. All illegal
    roadblocks in the affected communities and along the highways are to be
    dismantled to allow free flow of persons and goods. Law enforcement agencies
    have been directed to mount joint patrols to monitor the observance of the
    ceasefire and cessation of all forms of hostilities and vengeance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We have set up an inter-state peace and reconciliation
    committee to monitor the process of reconciliation and resettlement of
    displaced persons. The committee comprises their Royal Highnesses the Emir
    of Lafia and the Tor Tiv; the Commissioners of Police of the two states; the
    Commissioners for information; Local Government Chairmen and the Chairmen of
    traditional councils of the affected local government areas in both Nasarawa
    and Benue States. The Committee will be inaugurated tomorrow Tuesday 3rd
    July 2001 and shall commence work immediately thereafter.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I urge all those who are committed to a peaceful
    resolution of the crisis not to feel frustrated by the actions and
    pronouncements of the enemies of peace. I promise here and now that I will
    go to any length to achieve an amicable resolution of the crisis. I will
    work to bring the displaced persons back to their homes. We will re-unite
    families separated by the crisis. We will give homes and farms back to their
    owners. Peace will reign again by the grace of God. We will all become our
    brother's keepers once more.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Indeed, you would recall that the government had set up a
    judicial commission of enquiry into the lingering ethnic crisis before the
    eruption of the spate of violence. The commission is continuing with its
    work. I urge all those who have grievances and solutions to proffer to go
    freely before the commission so that together we can chart and walk the path
    of peace.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Some of you must have felt disappointed by the apparent
    inability of the state police command to respond decisively to the crisis to
    prevent it from assuming the dimension it did a few days ago. We must,
    however, appreciate the position of the police command here. It is a young
    police command in a young state. And because of the spontaneous nature of
    the violence, the officers and men of the command were over-stretched and
    were not able to fully protect lives and property in all the hot spots. But
    the situation has drastically improved. Following requests I made to the
    Force Headquarters, the Command has received reinforcements in men and
    logistics. It is now in a position to enforce law and order. Let me warn
    that anyone who chooses to stand in the way of the law enforcements agents
    will be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">In the wake of the crisis, some vigilante groups have
    sprung up. While some of them are genuinely out to help uphold law and order
    in their communities, others appear to be operating as ethnic militias. Some
    of these groups were reportedly hired from outside Nasarawa State. This
    administration does not recognize ethnic vigilantes and mercenary gangs
    hired from outside the State to escalate violence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I commend the efforts of genuine groups which have tried
    to maintain peace due to inadequate police presence. But such genuine
    vigilante groups must submit to the police and work purely under their
    guidance and instructions. Only the police, under our constitution, have the
    right to protect lives and property. The police have clear and unambiguous
    orders to arrest and deal with hired gangs or mercenaries who are here to
    turn our dear state into a battlefield. We cannot allow this state to
    degenerate into a state of anarchy. Anarchy is anathema to democracy. Our
    individual freedom can only flower in the garden of collective freedom. Let
    it be so. Communities or groups who set them up purely ethnic militia or
    hire soldiers of fortunes from outside are urged to disengage them
    immediately. Those who fail to do so stand the risk of prosecution.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">A truly frightening dimension to this violence is the
    incredibly large cache of arms in the possession of these groups. The civil
    society appears to be even better armed than the security agencies. We find
    this alarming and most unsettling. It poses a challenge not only to the
    security of Nasarawa State but that of the nation as a whole. Law
    enforcement agencies are under instruction to curb this dangerous arms build
    up. A militarized society is a dangerous society prone to perpetual violence
    and crime. We cannot allow this in our state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I wish to conclude this address with an appeal to all
    community and opinion leaders, and indeed every citizen of Nasarawa State to
    help government end this crisis by returning to the path of dialogue and
    peaceful coexistence.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Barely two months ago I undertook an extensive tour of all
    the Local Government Areas of this state and was overwhelmed by the
    outpouring of joy and friendship between the various ethnic groups in the
    affected parts of Nasarawa South Senatorial District now engulfed in violent
    hatred. Not only that, I presided over the People's Forum in each of the
    three senatorial districts which were attended by all the ethnic
    nationalities along with their cultural troupes which came to entertain the
    crowds.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">All community leaders, traditional rulers, local
    government chairmen and opinion leaders of all the ethnic groups were in
    attendance, and all of us discussed issues of common interest and community
    development. What a beautiful rainbow the people's forums were. Every group
    was present and Nasarawa State looked great and ready to march forward to
    meet the challenges of development and progress for our communities and our
    state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">You would also recall that the recurring theme in my
    speeches throughout the tour and at the People's Forum was the need for
    peace and peaceful coexistence and inter ethnic accommodation.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">I was and, in spite of this crisis, I am convinced more
    than ever before that we all need each other and we all must accommodate one
    another to be able to maintain the needed peace and solidarity without which
    it is impossible to achieve development and progress in a multi-ethnic state
    like ours. Hatred of neighbour will be the beginning of our downfall as a
    state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Inter-ethnic solidarity is a must in our state because the
    opposite will wreck the basis of our existence as a state, and disrupt all
    our development efforts and jeopardize the future of our children and
    generations yet unborn. I call on all our leaders and communities to take up
    the olive branch and embrace each other because there is no viable
    alternative to tolerance and good neighbourliness. We must all seek to be
    our neighbour's keeper. This is a precondition for our progress as a state.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We all struggled for decades to achieve autonomy and to
    have a state of our own dreams and aspirations. Our efforts and sacrifices
    will all be in vain unless there is peace. We did not fight to have a
    Nasarawa State that will be embroiled in turmoil. We did not fight for a
    Nasarawa State in which our children will live in fear. We did not fight for
    a Nasarawa State that will be embroiled in ethnic or religious intolerance.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We wanted a Nasarawa State that can compete with other
    states of the federation for advancement in all fields in order to improve
    the condition of living of our people and ensure prosperity for all our
    children. We wanted a state which will be dedicated to progress and
    committed to placing our people among the very best in Nigeria. These were
    the goals of our founding fathers.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It will be a great tragedy and a shame for all of us if we
    fail to appreciate that each time we raise the banner of ethnic separatism
    and hatred we diminish the prospects for progress and happiness in our
    communities. Each time we raise the cutlass against our neighbour we
    diminish the human spirit and promote chaos and disorder. We cannot afford
    this. Other parts of the country and the world will leave us behind.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">It is already shame enough that whereas other people are
    in space hoping to conquer the universe, we are embroiled in village
    quarrels and clannish hatred. NO, this must end, and very quickly too,
    because our children need peace to go to school, to compete with their
    counterparts in other parts of the country for a space in the future of
    Nigeria and the world. I call on our elites to rise beyond the confines of
    the village and of the clan to join hands with their neighbours and with the
    government to promote peace and development. There's absolutely no
    alternative to peace.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">May I stress that democracy is about the rule of law, and
    unlike other systems of government it demands the strictest enforcement of
    the due process. The freedoms democracy promises are not realizable outside
    the rule of law, and must therefore be exercised with the greatest sense of
    responsibility. No citizen has a right to take the law into his own hands.
    The spate of violence which we have been witnessing shows that our citizens
    are yet to embrace the rule of law and due process. No one has the right to
    engage in revenge attacks or to assume the role of the police and the state.
    I call on all community leaders to report all those in their domains who
    sustain this circle of violence through lawless acts.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Democracy is not a license for anarchy. Those who wait in
    the wings to promote destruction and looting in the name of vengeance are
    enemies of peace and will be dealt with within the full rigours of the law.
    We cannot tolerate the wave of arson and banditry by irresponsible elements
    who pose as sympathisers. The police and other law enforcement agents have
    been ordered to investigate recent cases of arson and looting in the State,
    and all those found guilty will be dealt with within the full rigours of the
    law of the land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">The present situation is a challenge to all of us to rise
    in defense of peace. Government has taken firm and irrevocable measures to
    end the violence. I appeal to community leaders at all levels to do their
    part by preventing violence in their communities. I urge you all to work
    hand in hand with government and law enforcement agencies to restore law and
    order, and to embrace the path of dialogue.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Let me sincerely thank state governors, foreign embassies,
    top government functionaries at federal and state levels, legislators and
    numerous friends of the government and people of Nasarawa State for their
    messages of sympathy, condolence and solidarity with us in our great hours
    of loss and pain. We appreciate their sentiments. We are touched by them. We
    are encouraged by their clear messages of support for our peace efforts. We
    assure them that with the support of the majority of the peace loving people
    of Nasarawa State, we will spare no efforts or expenses to put this horror
    and the pain behind us and continue with the race towards the Promise Land.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">We thank the press for the interest shown in the crisis in
    our state. We commend the maturity of their reporting so far but we ask them
    to guard against inflammatory reports that will only compound the delicate
    situation facing us. We urge them to maintain this level of objectivity as
    we enter the crucial stage in the restoration of peace in the areas torn by
    the crisis. They must not allow duplicitous elements to use them to mislead
    the people with false reports. My office is open twenty-four hours a day. So
    is the office of the state commissioner for information. We urge reporters
    to cross check their facts with responsible authorities at all times.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">My good people of Nasarawa State, let us resolve here and
    now to put the ugly events of the past few days behind us. Let our pain and
    our collective losses from this spate of violence be constant reminders that
    there is no alternative to peace and peaceful co-existence in our
    multi-ethnic state. Our resolve to be one happy family again, to learn from
    the mistakes that gave rise to this violence will defeat the forces of evil
    and disunity and thus move our state forward.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">Finally, let us all turn to God almighty in prayers for an
    end to this violence and for peace perpetual to reign in our dear young
    Nasarawa State. Thank you and God bless our State.</font>
