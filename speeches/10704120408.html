		<h1>Empowering Nigerian Women</h1>
		<h4></h4>
		
	
		
	
		<p align="justify"><em>Speech by His Excellency, Dr. Abdullahi Adamu (Sarkin Yakin Keffi and A’are Obateru of the Source), Executive Governor of Nasarawa State on the Occasion of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Quadrennial Convention of the National Council of Women Societies, Nigeria, Lafia, Friday, July 22, 2005</em></p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">It is with deep joy and warmth that I welcome you all to Nasarawa State on this historic occasion of the Second Quadrennial Convention of the Umbrella body of women in Nigeria. It is, indeed, an honour to host the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS), the largest network of Women Organisations in Africa. This event, which has drawn women from all cultural, religious, professional, social and political backgrounds for the purpose of promoting the unity and welfare of women, is quite significant in our nation’s march forward. I wish to add that the NCWS Convention, coming at this auspicious time, is integral to the consolidation of our nation’s democracy. In other words, as a potpourri of divergent and extensive women organisations and interests, the NCWS is a perfect reflection of the Nigerian nation and the sensibilities, hopes, and ambitions of our country for a better tomorrow for our people.</p>
<p align="justify">To all intents and purposes, the choice of this Convention’s theme, namely, "<i>The National Reforms – Women in Partnership</i>" is not only topical, but an all-time development code which Nigeria cannot afford to ignore. I, therefore, commend the NCWS at all levels for being realistic, serious-minded, foresighted and patriotic. This country is truly proud of you. From yesterday when delegates began to arrive from all the 36 States of the Federation and the FCT, the mood in Lafia and the entire State has transformed into one of festivity. I am particularly impressed by the enthusiasm, which pervades this event. It gives me more confidence yet, that our women are among the outstanding blessings which God in His wisdom has endowed the polity with. And a great force for positive national transformation and greatness.</p>
<p align="justify">As we all are aware, after four and a half decades of nationhood, Nigeria is going through a regime of reforms. Thanks to the return of democracy and the untiring efforts of our President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo (GCFR), Nigeria is confidently on the march again to national greatness. I believe that as we look ahead towards the fulfillment of our destiny as a nation, all stakeholders must renew their commitment to the Nigeria project.</p>
<p align="justify">I wish to draw your attention to the positive fruits of democracy in the past six years, and challenge you to engage in sober reflections on what the partnership of women can do in the pursuit of our aspirations as a nation.</p>
<p align="justify">A cursory look at the political, economic, infrastructural and attitudinal reforms being embarked upon by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Government since 1999 leaves no one in doubt that there is a deliberate policy of women empowerment and greater gender sensitivity in our effort to rebuild the nation. At both the Federal and State levels, women continue to play more roles than hitherto. Our President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has been a true role model in this regard. He has not only brought more women into government, he has entrusted women with the so-called power sectors hitherto dominated by men. Finance, Education, Housing, etc. have all been occupied by women Ministers who have demonstrated beyond doubt that there are many women out there with the magic formula for our nation’s rapid development.</p>
<p align="justify">In recognition of the fundamental place of women in the society, the Nasarawa State Government has consistently appointed more women into key decision-making positions since 1999. In so doing, the motive is to depart from the previous practice of excluding women or depriving them from contributing their quota to community and national development. Presently, we have four women in the Nasarawa State Cabinet and seven Permanent Secretaries. We intend to increase this progressively until we wipe out gender inequity and discrimination in the polity and social life of our State.</p>
<p align="justify">In the same vein, I call on Nigerian women to continue to plow their enormous potentials into the gigantic Nigeria project. There is a lot that you can do as individuals and groups to move this country forward. It is no gainsaying that, already, the Akunyilis, the Okonjo-Iwealas, the Oyos, the Nenadis and, of course the Bolaris Nwakeafors in the present dispensation have proved their mettle, and have continued to assert their worth. We are proud of you all and we urge you to be steadfast.</p>
<p align="justify">Inspired by the determination of the women-folk in Nasarawa State to participate in the comprehensive development of the State, Government has also disbursed loans to market women, housewives and other categories of women under the women and youth empowerment scheme with a view to meeting the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS) and its State derivate, SEEDS objectives.</p>
<p align="justify">Equally important is that women should embrace the increasing opportunities for empowerment by working in consonance with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>
<p align="justify">It is pertinent to note that the exclusion of the rural woman in the programmes that have direct bearings on their lives and welfare have often fallen short of achieving their lofty goals. I hope that the NCWS will endeavour to actively involve women at the grassroots in its activities, especially with the rising need for awareness and participation in governance and socio-economic programmes.</p>
<p align="justify">Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I want to use this moment to congratulate the leadership and all members of the NCWS for organising this Convention. The decision to hold the event in Nasarawa State deserves even more ovation. As you have seen for yourselves, Nasarawa State is where you would always want to return. I also commend the Council for the recognition and honour done to deserving men and women from various endeavours, including my humble self. Indeed, I cherish the award of "<i>Champion of Human Development</i>" bestowed on me by no less persons than the respected mothers of our great nation. I assure you that I will continue to do more to justify this recognition in consonance with the ideals of the award.</p>
<p align="justify">I hope that the food-fair which we all eagerly look forward to will effectively promote our rich array of culinary expertise, as well as open more vistas for the boosting of our food production potentials.</p>
<p align="justify">On this note, I wish to reiterate the clarion call on our farmers, particularly women farmers to rise to the occasion by reviving agriculture so that it can reclaim its pride of place in our economy. As you all are aware, cassava is in high demand in both domestic and foreign markets. I call on our women to explore cassava farming with a view to improving their income generation.</p>
<p align="justify">May I congratulate the Nasarawa State President of NCWS, Hajiya Ramatu Bala Usman and her team for successfully hosting Nigerian women in our State. The entire State is proud of you and all our women for this great effort.</p>
<p align="justify">Once again, I welcome you to Nasarawa State and urge you to savour its hospitality and the friendliness of its people.</p>
<p align="justify">I wish you successful deliberations.</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify">Thank you and God bless.</p>
