Nigeria: Options for Constitutional Remedies.</h2>

<p><i>ADDRESS DELIVERED BY ALHAJI ABDULLAHI ADAMU (SARKIN YAKIN KEFFI), 
EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF NASARAWA STATE AT A PRESIDENTIAL RETREAT ON PEACE AND 
CONFLICT RESOLUTION IN SOME CENTRAL STATES, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF POLICY AND 
STRATEGIC STUDIES (NIPSS), KURU, PLATEAU STATE, JANUARY 24-26, 2002</i><b><i>.</i></p>
</b>
<p>For over a decade now, North Central Nigeria has been plunged into a vortex 
of communal disputes. Hitherto peaceful communities are at each other's throat. 
Peoples that have cohabited peacefully in some instances for over a century are 
up in arms against each other. The age-old bonds that once bound communities 
together are falling apart with the unfortunate consequence that very minor 
disagreements often result in violence. From Kaduna to Jos, from Bauchi to 
Taraba, Benue and Nasarawa, a situation is rapidly developing which threatens to 
destabilize the entire Middle Belt or the North Central Zone. As leaders we are 
faced with a predicament we never prepared or bargained for. The meagre 
resources we get in the region are being frittered away on conflict management 
in a zone that is unarguably the poorest in Nigeria. </p>
<p>The situation in the Middle Belt demands urgent national attention for 
several reasons. First, this belt by its strategic geographical location is the 
connecting rod that binds the rest of the Nigerian federation together. Because 
it is so centrally located, instability in this region if left unattended could 
gradually tear the country apart. The movement of people and goods between the 
North and the South passes through this region. A major crisis in the region 
therefore has immense social and economic implications. </p>
<p>What has not been adequately highlighted in the current crisis in Taraba, 
Benue and Nasarawa states is the immediate danger it poses to Nigeria's food 
security. It is incontrovertible that these states are vital to the food needs 
of Nigeria. A high proportion of the nation's food production takes place in 
these states. Much of the yams, beans, fruits and rice consumed in the South and 
the far North come from these areas. If the nation fails to invest in resolving 
the current crisis in the region it will complicate the nation's food shortages 
in the years ahead with serious consequences for the nation. </p>
<p>The crises in the region also pose serious dangers to the stability of the 
nation's democracy. If left unattended these crises could rapidly erode people's 
confidence in democracy and shake the foundations of democratic institutions in 
the region and in other parts of the country. It is important that the nation 
work with the governments and peoples of the North Central zone to resolve the 
crisis as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Over and above the foregoing, the lingering crisis portrays our country as 
unstable and could scare investors away not only from investing in the region's 
rich economic potential, it could also scare international investors from 
Nigeria as a whole. No investor would want to take his capital into a country 
where there are incessant reports of ethnic wars.</p>
<p>The nation, therefore, must come to the aid of the North-Central Zone to 
invest in peace in the region because the Middle Belt has made the most 
sacrifices for the unity of Nigeria. This region bore the brunt of the civil war 
and has consistently made enormous sacrifices for the unity of Nigeria. Many 
families in this region lost precious sons for the unity of Nigeria. It is 
therefore fair to ask that the rest of Nigeria should stand by us in our hour of 
need.</p>
<p>I, therefore, wish to thank Mr. President for the abiding interest his 
administration has shown in resolving the crises in the zone. His perseverance 
in helping us come to a resolution of the crises is a source of inspiration for 
my colleagues and me. It reassures us that we are not alone and it strengthens 
our resolve to persevere until peace is attained. I am particularly delighted by 
the opportunity this retreat offers us to reflect and come to terms with the 
reality of dialogue as the only viable option out of our quarrels. I urge us all 
to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the retreat to take concrete 
steps to resolve the crises. </p>
<p>I am supposed to discuss the plenary presentations by the Hon. Minister of 
State for Justice, Hon. Musa Elayo Abdullahi and Alh. A. G. F. Abdulrazak (<i>SAN)</i>, 
titled <b>Constitutional and Practical Aspects of Nigerian Citizenship and the 
issue of &quot;Indigenes&quot; and &quot;Non-Indigenes&quot;. </b>As a discussant, I am supposed to 
be armed with copies of the presenters' papers in advance to be able to discuss 
the issues they raise therein. However, since I did not have access to their 
papers before the retreat, I have had to put down my own reflections on this 
important subject. </p>
<p>The Webster Dictionary of English Language defines a citizen as an inhabitant 
of a city or town, a member of a country, native or naturalized, having rights 
and owing allegiance. Citizenship and the issues associated with it are at the 
core of any nation. When President Clinton was leaving office at the end of a 
glorious two terms in office he remarked that he was happy to return to the most 
important title his country could offer him, which is Citizen Clinton. He said 
to be a citizen was more important than to be president because without the 
former, he could never have been president of the United States. </p>
<p>President Clinton's remark underlines the all-important place of citizenship 
in the life of a nation. The constitutions of all nations dwell on this subject. 
Our constitutions since 1960 have all defined citizenship of Nigeria. Chapter 25 
of the 1999 Constitution, which is in force, is devoted to the issue of 
citizenship. It defined a citizen as any person born in Nigeria either before or 
after independence either of whose parents or grand parents was born in a 
community indigenous to Nigeria; or every person born outside Nigeria either of 
whose parents is citizen of Nigeria. This is citizenship by birth. </p>
<p>The constitution also offers conditions on how any person who so desires 
could acquire Nigerian citizenship either by registration or naturalization. The 
constitution therefore offers the chance for even non-Nigerians to be citizens, 
provided they fulfil conditions prescribed therein. Being a citizen confers on 
one certain rights and duties which non-citizens could never enjoy. These rights 
and duties are also contained in the constitution, especially chapter four of 
the constitution, which dwells on fundamental human rights of citizens. </p>
<p>The Word &quot;indigene&quot; is not in the dictionary and may indeed be a uniquely 
Nigerian coinage from the word &quot;indigenous&quot; which is defined in the Webster 
Dictionary as born or living or found naturally in a locality, not imported; of 
or relating to natives. It is a biological term that has also assumed serious 
social and political meaning in Nigeria and around the world. For example, the 
term &quot;indigenous people&quot; has come to assume specific and significant meaning in 
the lingo of the United Nations over the decades depicting the conditions of 
peoples around the world who suffer rights violations in conditions of settler 
colonialism in new nations with altered demographic realities by &quot;newcomers&quot;. 
This term mainly focuses on rights violations on the basis of racial differences 
in multi-racial societies of the Americas, some parts of Asia, and North Africa 
where the populations of indigenous peoples of these regions have been swamped 
over the centuries by newcomers often of different races who now dominate 
economic and political power and use such power to limit the rights of 
indigenous racial groups.</p>
<p>The world &quot;indigene&quot; which is a Nigerian coinage is used to define natives of 
a particular place as against other citizens of Nigeria found in that locality. 
It is not discussed in the constitution, but it has assumed political 
connotation in virtually all parts of Nigeria as various communities and 
political units seek to protect themselves against newcomers. It is largely a 
product of Nigeria's multiethnic and heterogeneous status. It is used to confer 
special privileges on the natives which are beyond the reach of non-natives. At 
independence, all the former regions sought to use it to offer their peoples 
special protections in an environment. The nation was young and the regions were 
suspicious of each other. </p>
<p>The conflict between citizenship and &quot;indigene&quot; or &quot;non-indigene&quot; was there 
but the regions were very big and indigenes of each region enjoyed relatively 
the same privileges. A northerner was a northerner no matter where he lived in 
the North, just as a westerner was a westerner anywhere in the Western region. 
Although some level of dissent was noticeable in the multi-ethnic North and 
East, there was nothing close to what is witnessed today. </p>
<p>In spite of the obvious conflict between the rights of citizenship and the 
local protection of &quot;indigenes&quot; in the byelaws of the regions, it was 
fashionable because it hardly applied to members of communities within local 
units which were large enough to absorb the stress. Then non-indigenes were 
largely from afar and less interwoven than is the situation today. In the North, 
for instance, non-indigenes were largely citizens from Eastern or Western parts 
of the country and vice versa. Besides, opportunities were many for employment 
and very few qualified persons were available in the regions. </p>
<p>Further fragmentation of the country into smaller political units over the 
years have made the conflict more acute. Whereas a non-indigene in the First 
Republic in the North was hardly indigenous to the North, and was found mostly 
in the city and without any cultural or historical attachment to his place of 
residence, the situation prevailing now is quite different. Communities which 
hitherto belonged to the same political units and shared the same rights and 
privileges as &quot;indigenes&quot; suddenly find themselves on the opposite sides of the 
divide, one &quot;indigene&quot;, the other now &quot;non-indigene&quot;, the former enjoying 
privileges hitherto jointly enjoyed, the latter now on his own, deprived of the 
rights he/she had previously enjoyed in the same community which is also his 
natural habitat. </p>
<p>Although he is still indigenous to his place of residence, local political 
arithmetic alters his/her life suddenly, bringing him in sharp conflict and 
state of animus with his former brother and neighbour. This is the situation 
that has posed the greatest challenge in the North-Central zone, and which I 
also believe is relatively prevalent in other parts of Nigeria, especially the 
minority belts of the South-South and the North-East zones and some parts of 
North-West zone, which is perhaps the most heterogeneous zone in Nigeria. 
Indeed, I am told that even the homogeneous parts such as the South-West and the 
South-East suffer these shocks although on a relatively milder level compared to 
the North-Central. Examples of this conflict are the Ife/Modakeke, Umuleri/Aguleri, 
Urhobo/Itsekiri/Ijaw, the Zangon-Kataf, the Jos, Tafawa Balewa, the Tiv/Jukuns 
inTaraba, the Igbura/Bassa in Toto, and Nasarawa South communal conflicts which 
have so much hate and destruction. </p>
<p>Several factors fuelled the conflict between &quot;indigenes&quot; and other citizens. 
Ethnic differences account for only a narrow part of the explanation. In several 
cases, Ife-Modakeke for instance, the feuding communities have lived together 
for centuries and are of the same ethnic stock. The same goes for 
Umuleri-Aguleri. So the conflict between &quot;indigenship&quot; and citizenship is not 
restricted to communities of different ethnic nationalities. People of the same 
ethnic origin are caught in the same trap in several places in parts of the 
country. And as stated earlier, it does not matter how long people have lived 
together. </p>
<p>Other underlying factors fuelling the conflicts in the North Central zone and 
elsewhere are land scarcity, declining economic opportunities and competition 
for scarce resources. Some of these crises have a long history, but their 
escalation in recent years coincides with Nigeria's economic decline, dwindling 
opportunities and grinding poverty. And in the absence of a buoyant economy, 
elites in the areas look forward to political office as the surest access to 
resources. This makes politics a do-or-die affair where every tactic is employed 
to wrest power at the local level. This also fuels the circle of crisis.</p>
<p>It would appear therefore that the lasting solution to the crisis is the 
deliberate deployment of resources to invest in the region's vast economic 
potential in order to expand employment opportunities for the youth most of whom 
are unemployed and ready to foment trouble at the slightest opportunity. The 
Federal Government of Nigeria must therefore develop a Marshall Plan of sorts to 
save the North-Central zone from the crippling poverty, which fuels the 
conflicts in the region.</p>
<p>The region also has a high number of ex-servicemen who after serving the 
country diligently have retired into poverty. The eruption of crises couple with 
the free flow of arms in the zone enables them to feel useful once again, by 
placing their martial expertise at the disposal of their communities, or serving 
as mercenaries to the highest bidder in the conflicts. Something must be done to 
monitor and engage the ex-service men in the region productively in order to 
stop them from being used to fuel these crises. </p>
<p>The challenge before us as leaders is to build a country of equal 
opportunities for our citizens. The permanent management of scarcity through 
quotas and restrictions can only breed crisis and poverty. Our new democracy 
must deliver results to assuage our peoples' frustration, which makes them prone 
to violence at the slightest provocation. The answer lies largely in strategic 
investments by the Federal and State governments, and transparent management of 
resources towards target national goals of economic revival and prosperity for 
all citizens. This will dissipate the fears that now drive communities and which 
fuel the fierce competition for scarce opportunities with attendant violence in 
the zone. </p>
<p><b>OPTIONS FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS </b></p>
<p>The constitution cannot fix all problems. It is neither desirable nor helpful 
to do so. But it must address the practical problems of citizenship and seek to 
assuage the fears of the weak in order to achieve the prospects of national 
integration and development. How this can be achieved is the enduring challenge 
of our young federation. This challenge is very enormous because attitudes are 
still far behind the general trends around the world toward integration. But we 
must start from somewhere. </p>
<p>In the course of the crisis in Nasarawa South Senatorial District, which 
pitched the Tivs against their neighbours, our administration took the pragmatic 
path and declared that as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious community, the 
basis of our unity should be to accept this reality. As a government, we offered 
protection to all the groups and sought peace through unity in diversity. This 
was not an easy path to take but the alternative is separatism and perpetual 
turmoil. </p>
<p>I believe a way out of these problems must be sought through appropriate 
constitutional review to give vigour to common citizenship, while finding a way 
to protect the weak and local sensibilities and mores. </p>
<p>I believe further integration will promote rather than deter development. I 
believe we cannot build a country of our dreams without resolving the question 
of citizenship. And, I believe we can have full citizenship rights for all our 
people with adequate protection for the weak and the minorities through 
affirmative action where necessary and a determined expansion of opportunities.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, I urge participants at this retreat to come up with 
constitutional as well as pragmatic proposals for ending the crisis in the 
North-Central and in other regions of Nigeria. I propose a two-prong approach of 
constitutional review to enforce common citizenship rights as well as provisions 
to protect minorities through affirmative action. I propose the rapid expansion 
of economic opportunities for all Nigerians as the lasting solutions to most of 
the crises, which are rooted in poverty and scarce opportunities. I propose a 
coordinated and deliberate plan by the Federal Government to develop the 
North-Central Zone in order to save the region from poverty and crisis. </p>
<p>I urge our leaders not to seek the cheap option out of the current crises, 
which is separatism and permanent enmity and perdition. Our people must be 
reconciled because that is the only road to peace and development in the Middle 
Belt. We are bound together by history and geography and common destiny. If we 
fail to accept one another, the rest of the country shall definitely leave us 
further behind. At a time, some nations are in space and working on missions to
</p>
<p>put life on Planet Mars, we cannot be permanently trapped in mundane village 
quarrels with neighbours who have shared history and destiny. We must aspire 
beyond the village level or else, we risk the prospect of weakening the 
foundations of Nigeria's greatness, which is the only hope that the black man 
shall one day join his Caucasian cousins in the common project of advancing the 
place of humanity in the universe. Our people deserve peace and we must work 
hard to secure reconciliation and peace. This is our enduring challenge, and the 
challenge democracy places on us and our people. Once again, thank you Mr. 
President, Mr. Vice President and distinguished participants, ladies and 
gentlemen for your attention.</p>
