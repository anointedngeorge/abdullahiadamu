		<p align="left"><em>Address Presented By His Excellency, The Executive Governor Of Nasarawa State, Alhaji (Dr.) Abdullahi Adamu (Sarkin Yakin Keffi) On The Occasion Of The Passing-out Ceremony Of The 2003 Batch ‘B’ Corps Members At The Parade Ground, Lafia On Tuesday, 17<sup>TH</sup> August, 2004</em></p><p align="left">On the 12<sup>th</sup> of September 2003, I had the privilege of welcoming you to Nasarawa state on the occasion of your swearing-in ceremony and commencement of tour of duty at the NYSC temporary orientation camp at Keffi. At that occasion, I charged you to be prepared for the challenges of service to your fatherland and the communities that were to host you. I also requested you to consider yourselves as stake holders in the Nigeria Project. Ten months after my address to you, and a journey that I can describe as a life enriching stay in Nasarawa state, I am sure most of you have come to realize that the service year is a worthy experience. It is on this note that I consider it my pleasure to congratulate you on the successful completion of your service year in Nasarawa state.</p>
<p align="left">On the occasion of your passing out ceremony, I wish to commend your contributions to Nigeria in the national development process. Your contributions have really served to advance both the course of democracy and development in our country. While I salute your efforts, the completion of the National Youth Service should not be regarded as the end of your service to the nation. National service is a continuum. Participation in the NYSC programme is only a stage in the life of responsible and patriotic citizens, which opens doors to fresh opportunities and challenges. You should regard the one-year national service as a springboard for greater contributions and services in diverse areas of our national life. I have no doubts that the NYSC programme has adequately equipped you for such roles.</p>
<p align="left">The service year was conceptualized by its founding fathers to be a scheme channeled to the unity of this country. It was meant to be a scheme that will introduce our youth to different cultures and norms other than the ones they were hitherto accustomed to. The vision was to provide an opportunity for our youth to be committed to the ideals of one united Nigeria in spite of our differences. The scheme was also designed to inculcate in the Nigerian youth the spirit of selfless service to the community and to emphasize the spirit of oneness and brotherhood of all Nigerians, irrespective of cultural or social backgrounds. It is my belief that you have made positive, notable and qualitative impact on members of your host communities for which reason you will be remembered in the history of such communities and Nasarawa State in general.</p>
<p align="left">As you finally begin life as adults, I consider it expedient to familiarize you with the new focal point of the government as led by President Olusegun Obasanjo which emphasizes transparency and due diligence. This new focus is designed by this administration to fight corruption in the public service and give equal opportunities to all Nigerians to compete fairly. I am sure that as most of you go into the public and private sectors of the economy, you will interact with this focus. I urge you to do all within your capabilities to give muscle to this vision. Much is expected of you by the government in consolidating this ideal, just as the actions and decisions you take will either promote or mar the good intentions of government. As young men who have come from various communities to serve in our state, I am sure you have experienced the challenges of the Nigerian state. The lot falls on you as future leaders of this country to make determined efforts to change Nigeria for the better in whichever vocation you may find yourselves.</p>
<p align="left">I am sure that in the next few weeks and months, most of you will seek employment in various public and private establishments. It would be unwise to assure you that all of you will find employment either in the public or private sectors of the economy. The truth is that the number of graduates out number available vacancies. Consequently, an option available to you would be to seek self-employment opportunities. It is in this regard that government’s socio-economic policies and programmes have been focused on the principle of private sector development as the effective engine of social development. It is our belief that private sector led development efforts will not only free government from unwarranted economic activities, but also expand the scope of the economy and create more employment opportunities for our teeming youths. Most of our policies are geared towards creating the enabling environment and avenues for youth enterprises and self-employment. It is our hope that you will take advantage of skills you learnt during the service to engage in entrepreneurship activities. Government has provided enabling environments through its agencies such as SMIDA and provision of SMI funds through the Bank of Industry. All these, if adequately exploited will provide an avenue for you to actualize your dreams of a prosperous and fulfilling life.</p>
<p align="left">I am sure that in the course of your stay in Nasarawa state, you met some families and individuals who will become lifelong acquaintances. I urge you to keep these relationships as reason for you to visit our state in the years to come. We will always keep our doors open to welcome you back to Nasarawa state. And whenever you have the opportunity to host anybody from our state, we hope you will extend warm courtesies to them in remembrance of your stay with us.</p>
<p align="left">My dear compatriots, as you pass out today I enjoin you to allow the useful experiences and lessons of patience, tolerance, dignity of labour, solidarity of our oneness be your guiding principles. I encourage you to imbibe the fear of God in all your dealings in order to change our society for the better. Let the whole world see a changed Nigeria through your efforts and refined behaviour as a result of the leadership training you have acquired in the course of your service.</p>
<p align="left">I wish you more fruitful years of service to our fatherland and success in all your future endeavours.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Thank you and God bless.</p>
