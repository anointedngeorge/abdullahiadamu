<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is my pleasure to be in the midst of Agwatashi community today to share the joy of this memorable occasion of which l have just performed.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">It is the belief of this Administration to honour any society which deserved to benefit from the dividends of democracy as a mark of reciprocating the gesture of their labour as at and when due. This of course, if accomplished, ushers in peace in the community, with a view to also give room for future development.</p>
<p align="left">Since the inception of this administration in 1999, government has been looking at cases of communities that have been maginalised with a view to correcting the path of history thereby placing each community appropriately. With the creation and subsequent upgrading of benefiting District Heads of the new Chiefdoms to third class Chiefs, Government has deliberately closed the long existing gap between the Governed and the Government. It is the wishes of this administration to sustain such institutions with a view to achieving the aims and objectives for the creation of these new Chiefdoms. Gone are the days when communities were not allowed the privileges to freely express their feelings, and attain the rights as at and when required. This administration is on course and is determined to ensure an adequate achievement of its goals.</p>
<p align="left">Thus, every society shall be emancipated through an equitable distribution of social amenities to pep up the lives of our communities. Rural emancipation programs of this administration shall go beyond what we are witnessing today.</p>
<p align="left">Indeed, this Administration embarked on series of capital projects which have direct bearing on the lives of the people in towns and rural areas. We shall continue to provide rural dwellers with the needed social infrastructure to facilitate the development of every nook and crannies of the state.</p>
<p align="left">Government is aware that Obi Local Government area has a large deposit of the best coal deposits in the Country. It will interest you to note that during the recently concluded Agric show and Solid Minerals Exposition held in Keffi, Government deliberately intended to advertise its rich mineral status with a view to wooing investors to tap most of these hidden and untapped resources Government has indicated its intention to shift its focus from the continuous dependance on Petroleum to the detriment of other sources of revenue. Efforts will therefore be made to give attention to the coal deposit and exploration of other mineral resources. Government shall continue to put pressure on the federal government to see that excavation commences on some mineral deposits in the state. Already it is evident that the Federal Government had renovated the steel company residence in Obi town, l hope this will not be allowed to waste away again.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Agricultural activities shall be encouraged to boost the economy of our people. Merchandised farming will be encouraged so that cost of production will be minimized and high yield of production will be encourage.</p>
<p align="left">It will suffice to note that there can be no development in an atmosphere of rancour. This is why I have on several occasions cautioned communities on the need to maintain law and order. My first tenure in office witnessed series of communal crisis and this really hampered development in this area of the State as a lot of resources which could have been utilized for development went sunk in to maintenance of peace and order following the Nasarawa Southern Senatorial crises. I am particularly happy that all communities have embraced peace and have decided to live in peace with one another. It is my sincere prayer that you will continue to eschew bitterness and coexist peacefully with one another.</p>
<p align="left">Since I commenced the installation and presentation of third class staff of office to newly upgraded chiefs, this administration has recorded demands from various communities, let me reiterate that people that cannot live peacefully with members of their immediate communities should not expect any viable projects from the government. Let us put an end to these crisis as our generation yet unborn will not forgive us for this carriage. Those that have professionalised themselves in causing problems should retract as government will no longer spare them in due course.</p>
<p align="left">Distinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have listened keenly to the Transition Committee Chairman’s request and wish to assure that Government shall intensify efforts to step down transformers and make provision for Adudu, Agwatashi and Daddere Communities to benefit from the electrification project in phases when ever funds are available before the end of my tenureship.</p>
<p align="left">Similarly, the Ministry of Education shall look into the possibilities of upgrading the Government Secondary School Agwatashi to a full fledge Boarding School.</p>
<p align="left">Distinguished ladies, and gentlemen, I thank you all for supporting my administration in its process to provide social amenities to my people. May Allah grant you journey mercies back to your destination.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Thank you and God bless.</p>
